As I was in a rush and didn’t have time to go back I asked her to put it through anyway as it wouldn’t make a difference to Coles stock control and only a few cents were involved.  She refused and was rude at the same time. My granddaughter burst into tears with the rudeness and the fact that she couldn’t have her lollies.I put in a complaint with the store manager JENNIE who was not in the least bit sympathetic.  They had no protocol for writing a complain .. no book to log the complaint … and just said she had heard what I had to say.I was so upset for my little granddaughter who was allowed these sweets as a special treat and then had them denied to her.Even other customers in the queue appealed to TOFEA to let the child have the lollies and she refused.Won’t be going back to COLES again.

I tried phoning the number given but gave up after 15 minutes despite a recorded message constantly thanking me for holding and advising that someone would be with me \""shortly\"".  I don't know what Coles management considers \""shortly\""  - perhaps they count on the long wait time causing customers to give up so they do not have to deal with complaints. Previously I had an order  booked for 8am-2pm delivery and it arrived at 5pm.  (I suppose I should be grateful it arrived at all!)  Woolworths delivery charges may be more expensive but at least they are reliable."",""reviewRating"":{""@type"":""Rating"",""bestRating"":""5"",""worstRating"":""1"",""ratingValue"":""1""},""publisher"":{""@id"":""https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1""},""inLanguage"":""en""},{""@type"":""Review"",""@id"":""https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/blog.coles.com.au/63167d7b6a3e1ed2c3cabc96"",""itemReviewed"":{""@id"":""https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/blog.coles.com.au""},""author"":{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Dave Thompson"",""url"":""https://au.trustpilot.com/users/6314fa9883466e0012695575/""},""datePublished"":""2022-09-06T00:51:40.000Z"",""headline"":""Gutless Managers who dont want to talk to customers."",""reviewBody"":""Why are the managers at Coles gutless people and not want to talk to unhappy customers.

When we got to the check out she put the bag on the conveyor belt which excitement and pride that she had done this.The check out lady TOFEA was rude in pointing out that the lollies could not be mixed.  As I was in a rush and didn’t have time to go back I asked her to put it through anyway as it wouldn’t make a difference to Coles stock control and only a few cents were involved.  She refused and was rude at the same time. My granddaughter burst into tears with the rudeness and the fact that she couldn’t have her lollies.I put in a complaint with the store manager JENNIE who was not in the least bit sympathetic.  They had no protocol for writing a complain .. no book to log the complaint … and just said she had heard what I had to say.I was so upset for my little granddaughter who was allowed these sweets as a special treat and then had them denied to her.Even other customers in the queue appealed to TOFEA to let the child have the lollies and she refused.Won’t be going back to COLES again.

When we got to the check out she put the bag on the conveyor belt which excitement and pride that she had done this.The check out lady TOFEA was rude in pointing out that the lollies could not be mixed.  As I was in a rush and didn’t have time to go back I asked her to put it through anyway as it wouldn’t make a difference to Coles stock control and only a few cents were involved.  She refused and was rude at the same time. My granddaughter burst into tears with the rudeness and the fact that she couldn’t have her lollies.I put in a complaint with the store manager JENNIE who was not in the least bit sympathetic.  They had no protocol for writing a complain .. no book to log the complaint … and just said she had heard what I had to say.I was so upset for my little granddaughter who was allowed these sweets as a special treat and then had them denied to her.Even other customers in the queue appealed to TOFEA to let the child have the lollies and she refused.Won’t be going back to COLES again.

When we got to the check out she put the bag on the conveyor belt which excitement and pride that she had done this.The check out lady TOFEA was rude in pointing out that the lollies could not be mixed.  As I was in a rush and didn’t have time to go back I asked her to put it through anyway as it wouldn’t make a difference to Coles stock control and only a few cents were involved.  She refused and was rude at the same time. My granddaughter burst into tears with the rudeness and the fact that she couldn’t have her lollies.I put in a complaint with the store manager JENNIE who was not in the least bit sympathetic.  They had no protocol for writing a complain .. no book to log the complaint … and just said she had heard what I had to say.I was so upset for my little granddaughter who was allowed these sweets as a special treat and then had them denied to her.Even other customers in the queue appealed to TOFEA to let the child have the lollies and she refused.Won’t be going back to COLES again.

When we got to the check out she put the bag on the conveyor belt which excitement and pride that she had done this.The check out lady TOFEA was rude in pointing out that the lollies could not be mixed.  As I was in a rush and didn’t have time to go back I asked her to put it through anyway as it wouldn’t make a difference to Coles stock control and only a few cents were involved.  She refused and was rude at the same time. My granddaughter burst into tears with the rudeness and the fact that she couldn’t have her lollies.I put in a complaint with the store manager JENNIE who was not in the least bit sympathetic.  They had no protocol for writing a complain .. no book to log the complaint … and just said she had heard what I had to say.I was so upset for my little granddaughter who was allowed these sweets as a special treat and then had them denied to her.Even other customers in the queue appealed to TOFEA to let the child have the lollies and she refused.Won’t be going back to COLES again.

When we got to the check out she put the bag on the conveyor belt which excitement and pride that she had done this.The check out lady TOFEA was rude in pointing out that the lollies could not be mixed.  As I was in a rush and didn’t have time to go back I asked her to put it through anyway as it wouldn’t make a difference to Coles stock control and only a few cents were involved.  She refused and was rude at the same time. My granddaughter burst into tears with the rudeness and the fact that she couldn’t have her lollies.I put in a complaint with the store manager JENNIE who was not in the least bit sympathetic.  They had no protocol for writing a complain .. no book to log the complaint … and just said she had heard what I had to say.I was so upset for my little granddaughter who was allowed these sweets as a special treat and then had them denied to her.Even other customers in the queue appealed to TOFEA to let the child have the lollies and she refused.Won’t be going back to COLES again.

Not only those plastic packs add to the cost of the product, but they also add millions of items to the mountains of unprocessed plastics that keep growing across the country. Amazing wastage, all in the name of convenience?
