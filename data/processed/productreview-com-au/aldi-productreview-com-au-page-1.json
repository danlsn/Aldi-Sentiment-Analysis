            "reviewBody": "I usually shop online from Coles or Woolworths for grocery.  Several times, since I was in Chatswood, I dropped into Aldi to pick up some items.  Problem (1): There is always a long queue and long wait at check-out, and one particular female cashier was almost always discourteous and loud.  I have learned to avoid her, but today at around noon, she was the only one serving so I had no choice. When I got there, I showed her my shopping bag that had two small gardening items from another shop.  She looked, nodded and started scanning.  When I was about to pack away the items, she asked to check my backpack.  When I said I would show her after I had packed the grocery away, she suddenly wanted to see the shopping bag again in addition to the backpack.  It was a loud and blunt demand, giving the im0ression that she thought I had shop-lifted.  Of course there wasn't anything of Aldi's in my bag and backpack, but there was no hint of apology or even a \"thank you\" from her. \nProblem (2): Price - Comparing the prices of similar items sold by Coles and Woolworth, it is a myth that Aldi is cheaper.  Some items might be a few cents less, but others are similar or even more expensive.  Besides, Aldi never has discounts on real food for the dinner table, whereas different specials/half-price items are always offered by the other two supermarkets every week. I do weekly online shopping at Coles, and would save at least 1/3 of the total cost and only pay a small delivery fee to have the grocery delivered to the front door - $4 and even $2 if I choose a 6-hour delivery window.  If there is any complaint concerning any item (e.g, vegetable not fresh, egg cracked...), I get a refund straight away and no questions asked.  Conclusion - I would be extremely foolish to ever go back to Aldi again.",

            "reviewBody": "My friends and I compare notes when shopping and it came up in the discussion that rather than raise their prices (much), Aldi are reducing the amounts in the packets.....\n\nThis is a generic issue, of say Product X was $5.99 per kilo.\n\nInstead of bumping price up to $6.99 or $7.99 a kilo, they reduce the product in the packet from 1 Kg to 800 grams.\n\nSo while it's not illegal and it's all advertised, it's a bit of a sleight of hand \"fine print\" (don't make waves) kind of a con job.\n\nYou know the packs look the same size and the price is the same.... But....\n\nYou walk into the store assuming that buying 20 x what appear to be the same old 1 Kg packs of XYZ product, is going to get you 20 Kg of product, and then you find that your only getting 16 Kg of product.\n\nOh the monthly shop up - lets start looking at other vendors.\n\nLike the local green grocers and market  gardeners and butchers....",

            "headline": "Poor customer service!",
            "reviewBody": "Out of the 3 main stream supermarkets here in Australia ive always had slight soft spot for ALDI with what they have to offer. I mean its undeniable that they have some interesting products to produce and the \"special buys\" has always been an indistinguishable plus of the store. But after my recent dealings with this company and particular store as a whole, ive now got entirely different attitude towards the franchise.\n\nALDI in its own words have 3 main core values towards its customers and these are, quoted from their own website; Consistency, simplicity and responsibility. The one that stands out the most here too me is the responsibility aspect. Quote on quote ALDI states under this that \"{responsibility} Stands for our commitment towards our people, customers, partners and the environment, as outlined in our CR Principles. It also includes principles such as fairness, honesty, openness, service standards and friendliness.\" Something that now proves to be almost utterly false.\n\nLets talk about my experience at hand, a individual known to us (who to which seems to have an unrealated personal issue with us for an unknown reason) began working at my local store. Now I've been shopping here, with next to absolutely 0 issues since it opened and found it too be pleasant other then a obvious decline in the \"special buys\" availability. However alittle over a year ago i was shopping here and this previously mentioned individual so happened to be working that same day, un-to-known to us at the time, this person who has some issue with us, took it apon them selves to tell members of this store, including the manager, a fabricated story which resulted in a disgusting response by those involved. They proceeded to make a scene, including the check out chick who literally threw the groceries at us and all of those involved told us we weren't to come back. This individual who mind you wasnt the one who threw the stuff at us, then left their register and then followed us outside to continue the altercation, meanwhile there was people waiting to be served by this person. To trim the story down, they essentially told us were not allowed back, we wouldn't be served if we did come back and that police could be called. A staff member too, after we'd left, who wasnt even working that day had been called and came and abused us outside of the store entirely. After all of this we proceeded to call customer service which was the biggest joke as well as sending various emails in regards to it all. We were also told maybe I'd be better to shop elsewhere or on a day this person wasnt here. So we then took precautions such as getting other family members to go in or trying to go in on days this person wasn't here and this created a slightly less hostile  environment.\n\nAlittle over a year later, long after this, today as im writing this infact, we decided to go in there since we knew this person wasnt working and the fact that we had gone in 2 weeks prior with no issues at all. So therefore we assumed everything to be okay now. The shop started off normal we got our stuff that we needed and were finishing up when a two thug like staff members approached very rudely and proceeded to evict us from the store. We proceeded to ask on what terms were we actually banned from the store and both of these thugs couldn't actually provide a reason other then \"that we've been told your banned\". They claimed to have mailed a banning notice, to which was false. They didn't service a notice of any sort at the time to say the reasoning for this ban other then simply verbally stating that we were banned. They also told us that we wouldn't be served which meant we had to abandon the trolley full of goods in the supermarket. Throughout this whole ordeal they also proceeded to call the police which we insisted they do as they had no reasoning to stand on, to which the police arrived. We spoke with two very nice police officers who proceeded to hear what happened and said that theyd talk to the manager and see the reasoning before theyd get back too us. They never did, so we assumed there wasn't a legitimate reason for a ban.\n\nUnder the discrimination act of 2010, to which a organisation must provide a safe and bully free environment to consumers however this isn't the case with ALDI and it seems that this kind of behaviour is acceptable. They can literally get away with bullying, harassment and emotional abuse over simply disliking you as a person and nothing more. Ive also been made aware too that i can be \"blacklisted\" with my personal information, which can be distributed to other stores who can ban me too for absolutely doing nothing at all. \n\nALDI has not been fair in there treatment considering we haven't broken a law like shoplifting, we haven't verbally assaulted anyone or physically for that matter. They haven't been fair in the way that they handle mismanagement by staff and rather sweep it under the mat for there the protect of the name. ALDI also hasn't been open or honest either, considering that there is no reason to stand on why we're actually banned or open about the process, management of the issue or result and would rather pass the blame to the customer showing ALDI's  inconsistency with there policies and values.\n\nI would never recommend working for this toxic group or shopping there in general. My situation make be somewhat unique but it show cased what ALDI Australia is truly like.",

As of this week, pretty much everything which I usually buy has gone up and the quality has dropped.\nNow I have stopped buying non essential items like biscuits and yogurt among other things from Aldi. Now I buy some grocery items at Coles which are on special. Pretty soon I wont be shopping at Aldi anymore as its just getting too expensive. Maybe your slogan should be something like Good, Different, Expensive.",

            "reviewBody": "I had a problem at Aldi Chirnside Park where the checkout person damaged an item and then was rude when I mentioned it to them. I used the Aldi customer service store complaints form and after completing it says there is an approximate 4-step process. Someone contacted me from Customer Service, asked for specific details, apologised, and said I would be contacted within 48 hours by the store in question after they had looked into it. A week later no one had rung. So I used the form again and I spoke to someone who apologised that the process had failed and someone would contact me within 48 hours, A week later, no one contacted me. I sent in another contact form asking what happened, and NOTHING.\nAldi advertises well, they look like a good store to switch to, but when there is a problem they don't do what they state they'll do, which is to offer professional customer service. Of the 4 steps they offer, they only get to 2 and disappear.\nI was a happy convert, but I don't wish to pay the wages of staff that are rude to me, and damage my purchases, so I will go back to where I was shopping previously.\nIt's great to have good advertising, but it needs to be followed up with professional customer service when it's required.",
