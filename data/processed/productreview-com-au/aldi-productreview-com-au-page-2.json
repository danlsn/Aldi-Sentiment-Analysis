            "reviewBody": "Aldi makes much of the fact that they employ Australians (well, duh !), to take the sting out of the fact that the profits all go back to the Motherland in Germany.  But after a few interactions with the rarely sighted employees, you will wonder how on earth these people keep their jobs.   They all have the aura of complete demoralisation; most don't even try to hide their disenchantment, openly griping about their managers in front of the growing line of customers while they gossip with their colleagues, eventually (maybe) getting around to opening up another check-out (if only there were other employees there to actually help).   \n\nNo amount of hipster advertising can put lipstick on this pig.  The novelty factor of Aldi wears off pretty quickly once you move beyond the very limited range of regular grocery items they sell that are of comparable value to Coles and Woolworths.  For the most part, their fresh food is of poor quality, their bread products are mostly awful, and their re-stocking process is appalling.    The majority of the weekly bargains they spruik to lure people in are mostly cheap tat.  \n\nAll in all: the stores are deliberately understaffed, head office eschews any innovations in self-check out that would require capital investment, they offer the lowest quality goods to screw prices down, and then send all their profits back to Germany.  For these reasons, Aldi is to be avoided.  Unless you're just flat out broke, or like the feeling of shopping in a developing Eastern European country in the early 1990s.",
