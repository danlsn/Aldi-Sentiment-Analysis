Few days later, I went back and needed to use the bathroom again. I was very pleased to see that they listened to my feedback and took action. Well done for considering customer's feedback and being efficient. I also should not forget to mention that there is a very nice sales assistant at one cash register that greets the customers and smiles, and is polite too. I think she has an Indian Background if you want to look for her.",

ALDIs limited time products which if your lucky, can be good which tempts you to keep coming back.

I am still very surprised that no one in ALDI management would take their time to read and take is seriously but then, could we argue that we are a minority? They claim to save 1500 a years? That would equate to 28.84 dollars a week. Big deal? When: as a guy put downwards regarding the meat quality and fat content, he is spot on. There is another user stating about the tuna and ruining a $ 20.00 meal. Well the tuna in spring water is just like paper, horrible. The whole normal fresh chickens are not good in odour and flavour. You need to buy the free range. So, in saying all this, where is the 28.84 dollars a week saving? Will buy me an Aston Martin ? I then end up going to Woolworths where they take advantage but the compared to Aldi the majority of the food taste and aroma as such is different. It is really sad as we need a balance to keep the others honest, somehow but it is not happening. Whatever they want to protrude as \" price\" , then what exactly is the advantage? I just had to throw away the apples my wife purchased at Aldi. They have no flavour and no idea from which tree they ever came from either? Fresh red salmon, is 10 out of 10...........but the difference in price with Woolworths is not gigantic. I still buy with a lot of care a few things. Consistency is not there either. I am ultra disappointed. Das ist nicht gut !",

If I wanted cheap tuna I would have paid less and gone to Coles or Woolies home brand. There meat has also become 25-40% more expensive and has more fat than before so I'd say 40-60% more expensive. There fruit and vegetables are also of a lesser quality, apples lower grade and don't get me started on the zucchini and other fruit and vegetables. Who wants huge oversized items, certainly not your majors who are charging more for better quality. I could go on forever but check out their weekly specials, can be had for a cheaper price if you look around. Don't get sucked in, Big W and Kmart are probably cheaper for better quality. Don't get me wrong I used to buy 10% of my groceries 10 years ago from Aldi then went to 80% but have now gone back to 50%. Check pricing carefully, light cream $2.09 Aldi, 2.10 Coles.",
