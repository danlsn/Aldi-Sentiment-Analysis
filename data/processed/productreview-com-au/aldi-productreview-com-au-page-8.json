Rear cam (max 480p) is a small weather resistant box with a bracket to be screwed into bumper (this works well if you want it to view your tow-ball connection). Fitting and setup is easy, and the rear cam comes with a cable long enough for a station wagon. SD card to be bought separately. If you connect the rear cam to a reversing light (wiring is setup provided) the display will revert to rear cam view when you put car in reverse. Great to line up tow-ball. You also get reversing HUD lines. Main display can be cycled through 1. Front only 2. Front and picture-in-picture Rear 3. Split Front/Rear 4. Rear only. No GPS which means you not only cannot record location, but also speed. Note, these two factors are a major player in accident evidence for insurance and courts.",

Their special buys are often tempting (eg. bulk dishwashing tablets, bikes, etc).\nIn general, Aldi's orange juice is great value for money.  Their breakfast cereals are great, dishwashing tablets superb, laundry detergent, dim sims, bread, olive oil.  The list of great items is huge.  They absolutely represent value for money.\nAldi's milk is nowhere near as nice as Costco's milk.  Their tuna leaves a lot to be desired.  Their fresh produce is often averagely priced.\nTo be honest, there's little to fault at Aldi.  There's no membership fee.  I've never had a problem with a return of an item.  The staff are probably less friendly than Costco, Woolworths and Coles.  Stores are clean.  If I had to single out a particular fault it's that some items are seasonal or you just can't buy them.  They used to sell great wholemeal spaghetti: they no longer do.",

Made from Aussie turkey breast and marinated for extra succulence and flavour.\n\nMy Description : From Frozen you cook it in the FOIL .. You remove the FOIL at the end of cooking for the last 30 mins - THIS WAS EXTREMELY HARD TO REMOVE AS IT THICK FOIL, VERY TIGHTLY WRAPPED AND OBVIOUSLY REALLY HOT.\nLooked ok when cooked but when slicing HAD A LOT OF FAT THROUGHOUT THE MEAT.\nIt had SO MUCH SALT IN IT YOU COULDN'T TASTE THE MEAT ...I don't use Salt BUT if you are a person who adds Salt to their dinner BEWARE.\nOverall it LOOKED AND TASTED COMPLETELY PROCESSED.... DEFINITELY NOT WORTH $13.49.\n\nDo Aldi actually have COMPANY FOOD TASTERS ... People that ACTUALLY TASTE THEIR PRODUCTS before they decide to SELL THEM .... or do they all suffer with Ageusia !!!!! ?????",
