I just want Aldi to be aware that there maybe an issue with this product.",

Good enough to consume 'neat' (not in a recipe, but by the handful)\n\nKeep them in the fridge is my advice.\n\nOne star penalty- it should really be two, so despicable are they- for Aldi's egregious failure to respect their customers enough to be contactable by phone, and for their impossible to navigate online complaint form, using which-had it been usable-they could have been alerted to the walnut problem months earlier. I hope their uncontactability has cost them dearly. They deserve it.",

I took everything out of the box and unlike other units I had bought, this required 4 screws, 4 dowels that were not included but are required to build it.  Then came the build.. It has components that need to be slid (with thin metal tabs) into 2 sides of the main beams which would not slide in to the tabs not matter what I did. I would get one or 2 in, but never all. I tried gently tapping with a rubber mallet and dowel, but as these parts are so thin and flimsy they just bend and mangle making it even more impossible to connect them.  After 45 mins of complete an utter frustration, I took apart the small amount I had assembled and put all of it straight into a skip. I went to Bunnings and bought the comparable size and it uses pins to secure and took me all of 30 mins to completely assemble.  I will NEVER buy anything like this from Aldi again.  My advice, sty clear of this one..",

            "reviewBody": "Since covid commenced, I obviously still have to go shopping. The various health directions in the ACT are clear and binding. Wearing face masks is nothing new as is how to wear them. Over the past six months, I've walked into ALDI in Amaroo and staff were either not wearing any face masks, or a mask around their neck, or a mask merely covering their mouth but not their nose. Health directives require face masks to properly cover both mouth and nose. I've informed ALDI management on numerous occasions of staff not following health directions. But nothing ever changes. On 28 December 2021, the guy at checkout 1 had his nose fully exposed. The mask was merely hanging over his mouth and chin. When I pointed out that he wasn't wearing his mask over his nose, he gave a smart-crap response: \"Have you checked-in with the covid-app?\"  I find such a smart-crap come-back inappropriate... and yes, I did check-in with the covid app and I was wearing my face mask correctly - he wasn't.  Despite making a complaint last year, on 3 January 2022, another employee was also serving people with a mask merely covering his mouth and not his nose. The purpose of wearing a surgical mask is not to prevent staff from getting covid (although that might help a little) but it is to reduce staff exhaling viral loads should they be covid positive. That is why wearing the mask only covering the mouth is useless as staff can exhale the virus through their nose. A German online newspaper published a very interesting interactive image where you could choose the size of a room, how many people wore masks and how long people were in that room for. It then spat out infection rates etc. While surgical masks aren't fool proof, they can reduce transmission by 30% or so. Having had asthma all my life puts me in the high-risk category. I don't want any version of covid despite being fully vaccinated. But ALDI don't understand that. I guess profits are more important than public safety, right?",

            "reviewBody": "Aldi 700mm gas cooktop, auto shut off, ignition star.  Five burners with Central wok burner.  Near impossible to start first time, have to hold button-down at least 10 seconds after flame light, flame is inconsistent, rising and falling as you turn other outlets on and sometimes on it own. $400 wasted plus $200 to get plumber to fit and tune gas. Aldi has gone downhill.\n\nAnd recently one of the auto start ignition units has failed. Using matches.\n\nLove most ALDI products but their kitchen appliances are not quality.",
