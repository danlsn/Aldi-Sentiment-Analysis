Aurel,,Rude Cashier and poor service - Not worth saving a few cents for,1 out of 5 stars,"I usually shop online from Coles or Woolworths for grocery. Several times, since I was in Chatswood, I dropped into Aldi to pick up some items. Problem (1): There is always a long queue and long wait at check-out, and one particular female cashier was almost always discourteous and loud. I have learned to avoid her, but today at around noon, she was the only one serving so I had no choice. When I got there, I showed her my shopping bag that had two small gardening items from another shop. She looked, nodded and started scanning. When I was... about to pack away the items, she asked to check my backpack. When I said I would show her after I had packed the grocery away, she suddenly wanted to see the shopping bag again in addition to the backpack. It was a loud and blunt demand, giving the im0ression that she thought I had shop-lifted. Of course there wasn't anything of Aldi's in my bag and backpack, but there was no hint of apology or even a ""thank you"" from her. Problem (2): Price - Comparing the prices of similar items sold by Coles and Woolworth, it is a myth that Aldi is cheaper. Some items might be a few cents less, but others are similar or even more expensive. Besides, Aldi never has discounts on real food for the dinner table, whereas different specials/half-price items are always offered by the other two supermarkets every week. I do weekly online shopping at Coles, and would save at least 1/3 of the total cost and only pay a small delivery fee to have the grocery delivered to the front door - $4 and even $2 if I choose a 6-hour delivery window. If there is any complaint concerning any item (e.g, vegetable not fresh, egg cracked...), I get a refund straight away and no questions asked. Conclusion - I would be extremely foolish to ever go back to Aldi again.",2023-01-10T04:02:45.000Z,2,3,1,,False,4,,6,1,ProductReview.com.au,ALDI,1
Pedro,,No stock poor quality fruit and vegetables,2 out of 5 stars,My wife brought bananas again and as usual after few hours bruising appears length of banana not spots when ripening. Some of there salad items ok but most stock is second grade with premium price suggest you go to your local fruit shop to get good quality.

Seafood especially fish and prawns always scare especially thereAdvertise specials. Christmas specials advertised on TV weren’t available. Other majors seem to have the stock available now.

Vapour_path11,,Poor customer service!,1 out of 5 stars,"ALDI in its own words have 3 main core values towards its customers and these are, quoted from their own website; Consistency,... simplicity and responsibility. The one that stands out the most here too me is the responsibility aspect. Quote on quote ALDI states under this that ""{responsibility} Stands for our commitment towards our people, customers, partners and the environment, as outlined in our CR Principles. It also includes principles such as fairness, honesty, openness, service standards and friendliness."" Something that now proves to be almost utterly false. Lets talk about my experience at hand, a individual known to us (who to which seems to have an unrealated personal issue with us for an unknown reason) began working at my local store. Now I've been shopping here, with next to absolutely 0 issues since it opened and found it too be pleasant other then a obvious decline in the ""special buys"" availability. However alittle over a year ago i was shopping here and this previously mentioned individual so happened to be working that same day, un-to-known to us at the time, this person who has some issue with us, took it apon them selves to tell members of this store, including the manager, a fabricated story which resulted in a disgusting response by those involved. They proceeded to make a scene, including the check out chick who literally threw the groceries at us and all of those involved told us we weren't to come back. This individual who mind you wasnt the one who threw the stuff at us, then left their register and then followed us outside to continue the altercation, meanwhile there was people waiting to be served by this person. To trim the story down, they essentially told us were not allowed back, we wouldn't be served if we did come back and that police could be called. A staff member too, after we'd left, who wasnt even working that day had been called and came and abused us outside of the store entirely. After all of this we proceeded to call customer service which was the biggest joke as well as sending various emails in regards to it all. We were also told maybe I'd be better to shop elsewhere or on a day this person wasnt here. So we then took precautions such as getting other family members to go in or trying to go in on days this person wasn't here and this created a slightly less hostile environment. Alittle over a year later, long after this, today as im writing this infact, we decided to go in there since we knew this person wasnt working and the fact that we had gone in 2 weeks prior with no issues at all. So therefore we assumed everything to be okay now. The shop started off normal we got our stuff that we needed and were finishing up when a two thug like staff members approached very rudely and proceeded to evict us from the store. We proceeded to ask on what terms were we actually banned from the store and both of these thugs couldn't actually provide a reason other then ""that we've been told your banned"". They claimed to have mailed a banning notice, to which was false. They didn't service a notice of any sort at the time to say the reasoning for this ban other then simply verbally stating that we were banned. They also told us that we wouldn't be served which meant we had to abandon the trolley full of goods in the supermarket. Throughout this whole ordeal they also proceeded to call the police which we insisted they do as they had no reasoning to stand on, to which the police arrived. We spoke with two very nice police officers who proceeded to hear what happened and said that theyd talk to the manager and see the reasoning before theyd get back too us. They never did, so we assumed there wasn't a legitimate reason for a ban. Under the discrimination act of 2010, to which a organisation must provide a safe and bully free environment to consumers however this isn't the case with ALDI and it seems that this kind of behaviour is acceptable. They can literally get away with bullying, harassment and emotional abuse over simply disliking you as a person and nothing more. Ive also been made aware too that i can be ""blacklisted"" with my personal information, which can be distributed to other stores who can ban me too for absolutely doing nothing at all.

Geoff,,Customer service fail,2 out of 5 stars,"I had a problem at Aldi Chirnside Park where the checkout person damaged an item and then was rude when I mentioned it to them. I used the Aldi customer service store complaints form and after completing it says there is an approximate 4-step process. Someone contacted me from Customer Service, asked for specific details, apologised, and said I would be contacted within 48 hours by the store in question after they had looked into it. A week later no one had rung. So I used the form again and I spoke to someone who apologised that the process ha...d failed and someone would contact me within 48 hours, A week later, no one contacted me. I sent in another contact form asking what happened, and NOTHING. Aldi advertises well, they look like a good store to switch to, but when there is a problem they don't do what they state they'll do, which is to offer professional customer service. Of the 4 steps they offer, they only get to 2 and disappear. I was a happy convert, but I don't wish to pay the wages of staff that are rude to me, and damage my purchases, so I will go back to where I was shopping previously. It's great to have good advertising, but it needs to be followed up with professional customer service when it's required.",2022-12-13T08:57:38.000Z,,,,,,11,,8,2,ProductReview.com.au,ALDI,1

Gyps,,"Sneaky, deceptive, contempt for customers",1 out of 5 stars,"The rot started with LED light bulbs, which I bought in bulk. By the time it came to using them my receipt was out of date. So much for their 100% money-back guarantee. One after the other of the bulbs failed, the dimmable were a particular joke - flickering like a strobe, darkening, brightening and then reducing permanently stuck barely like a night light. Even though packaging clearly stated Aldi, refused to honour guarantee. Next: the porcini mushroom triangles. 3 packs fed four and leftovers. Suddenly we were fighting over five triangles... each. I looked at the packs and they had been drastically shrunken. But same price!!!! Ricotta in a basket, the same!!!! Laundry liquid - first the lid / measuring cup capacity doubled, meaning we were suddenly tricked into using more. Next purchase, the thick concentrated liquid had turned as thin as water!!! Now I tear through a bottle in weeks instead of months. The Lyttos yoghurt - God knows what they did there, but package change coincided with a decline in taste and consistency. Who knows how many more items have been doctored and fudged and tweaked to stooge their customers. So so deceitful, Aldi - you STINK.

george bouzidis,,Availability of product,2 out of 5 stars,A week ago the Aldi catalogue advertised 250gm Salmon Gravlax for $7.99 and Smoked Ocean Trout 300mg for $9.99 to be available from a certain day. I walked 2 kilometers to buy these products only to be told they had not arrived and to try the next day or the following days. I again visited the Morley branch and Inglewood branch only to be told that as a result of Covid 19 deliveries to stores could not be guaranteed. When other super markets sell out of product or it is unavailable one is able to obtain a rein check and be advised when the prod...uct becomes available. Not Aldi. It has happened before when a product is advertised and only small quantities are available thus tricking the customer to visit the store in the hope they buy other goods.

Kevin C,,ALDI's Poor Customer Service,1 out of 5 stars,"Tried to purchase a 60” 4K Ultra HD TV from ALDI. Local Store Manager said the catalogue item did not come in: “it may arrive in a week, or it could be a month, so check available stock details online.” The Manager’s parting comment was: “If we didn’t receive stock, neither will any nearby stores.”Looked at ALDI’s website, as suggested — “Special Buys Product Delays” and “Check Available Stock”. Of the twenty nearby stores: ten indicated - We are sold out; nine indicated - ! No stock information available; and one indicated - Stock availabl...e. Rang ALDI’s only listed contact number (13 25 34) to confirm the stock situation. The phone prompts indicated it was not possible to speak to a real person, let alone a specific ALDI store. So, I travelled over thirty kilometres to the store listed as having stock, only to find it had just two 4K TVs, both of which were faulty returns and as such were not available for sale. Come on ALDI, at least try to be fair dinkum. We understand hustling customers through checkouts and providing no store contact details is part of the model that keeps costs down. Nonetheless, ALDI could at least make an effort to ensure that the one and only point of contact system ALDI wants customers to use is at least capable of differentiating between Stock available (total stock inventory) and Stock Fit/Ready for Sale.",2021-11-29T07:26:08.000Z,,,,,,5,,,1,ProductReview.com.au,ALDI,10

Jules A.,,Different for sure. Good ? Nah.,2 out of 5 stars,"Aldi makes much of the fact that they employ Australians (well, duh !), to take the sting out of the fact that the profits all go back to the Motherland in Germany. But after a few interactions with the rarely sighted employees, you will wonder how on earth these people keep their jobs. They all have the aura of complete demoralisation; most don't even try to hide their disenchantment, openly griping about their managers in front of the growing line of customers while they gossip with their colleagues, eventually (maybe) getting around to op...ening up another check-out (if only there were other employees there to actually help). No amount of hipster advertising can put lipstick on this pig. The novelty factor of Aldi wears off pretty quickly once you move beyond the very limited range of regular grocery items they sell that are of comparable value to Coles and Woolworths. For the most part, their fresh food is of poor quality, their bread products are mostly awful, and their re-stocking process is appalling. The majority of the weekly bargains they spruik to lure people in are mostly cheap tat. All in all: the stores are deliberately understaffed, head office eschews any innovations in self-check out that would require capital investment, they offer the lowest quality goods to screw prices down, and then send all their profits back to Germany. For these reasons, Aldi is to be avoided. Unless you're just flat out broke, or like the feeling of shopping in a developing Eastern European country in the early 1990s.",2022-11-14T03:14:18.000Z,3,3,1,,False,3,,3,2,ProductReview.com.au,ALDI,2

Lhamo,"Perth, WA",Rude and bad day. Budget? Not really. Doesn't even deserve 1 star. That's the only way to rate.,1 out of 5 stars,I was packing while the check out was scanning. She was throwing a heavy product meat on the veggies. I asked her if she could wait while I move the veggies out the way. She said that's how Aldi works. While I tried to put couple of things in the bag she said you need to pay now. She wanted me to stop straight away and pay so that she could scan next customer. It made me feel extremely rushed and bad. Later on i went to woolies and bought products that were actually similar budget to Aldi. I realised why should i go to Aldi when the staff treats poorly and ruins entire day.,2022-09-18T07:44:22.000Z,,,,,,,,,1,ProductReview.com.au,ALDI,4

Content88,,Closing time is not 20 minutes to 8,2 out of 5 stars,"1. Entered Aldi Balwyn North this evening for a quick shop. Parked in the underground carpark and took the lift to the ground floor. Trolley tag in hand, was looking for a trolley. I asked the cashier where were the trolleys, and he said downstairs. So back downstair I go to grab my trolley, then back in the lift to the ground floor, to finally commence my shop.2. As soon as I pushed my trolley through the entry gates, I heard the announcement, ""this store will be closing shortly, please proceed to the registers"". I thought I had 19 minutes to... go, but I was going to be quick. Before I even made it to the end of the first aisle, the announcement was repeated. There are only 5 aisles at the store. I heard the announcement every 30-45 seconds! This is disrespectful to shoppers. I spent a total of $42.91 and checked out at 19:51, frazzled. I asked the cashier who controls the announcements, he said he is instructed to push the button every so often. Seriously? As a former checkout chick and front end controller, we used to advise customers 5 minutes before store close with one announcement, followed by another announcement 1 minute before the store closes. Aldi please review your procedures, and also ensure trolleys are available at all times.",2022-09-12T11:48:20.000Z,,,,,,5,,6,2,ProductReview.com.au,ALDI,4

Annoyed,,True Wireless Earbuds are not so true,1 out of 5 stars,"My partner recently bought me a set of Bauhn earbuds to use. Lovely packaging, proudly proclaiming the use of recycled plastic with Aldi name on warranty inside the box. Greenwashing at its allegedly certified best, for something that does not work. I tried to ring the number on the box to get some assistance from Bauhn. Apparently they are too busy dealing with a myriad of calls. Or so the dulcet tones of the recorded young person tells me. This means they obviously can't spare the time to deal with me. So, off to Aldi online I go to find a nu...mber so I can speak to a real person. But, they have obviously outsourced all their real talking people for some super dooper, online, money saving, customer duping response. This apparently will be the game changer and solve every problem I have with Aldi and Bauhn. Except, that has no ability to inform them of their useless, stupid, non working, waste of time and money, dopey, earbud rubbish.

Very Disappointed,"Greater Melbourne (Outer), VIC",Worst customer service experience,1 out of 5 stars,"Aldi Tarneit Gardens.I had a very nasty experience today. The assistant store manager at Aldi Tarneit Central absolutely berated and embarrassed me in front of the whole shop. I was paying half cash and half card. I paid $6 cash and there was $8.97 left on the till to go on card. Unbeknownst to me there was only $8.95 on the card. No problem. With technology nowadays it’s a 30 second transfer. But alas the reception at this Aldi is horrible so of course it took a bit longer. But honestly while he was walking around, banging the cash register,... berating me and shouting at me and teaching me a life lesson on how I should have organised my life better and been a better customer and showing with his actions how frustrated he was that I wasting his time the money had transferred and I was ready to pay. But he still wasn’t happy. I offered to go back in line inside he refused. I offered to go to another till. He refused. I walked away and just cried and cried in my car. I had one baby in my arms and 3 year old with me. I don’t know. Is this a classic example of when you put a man of colour in a position of power they think they can talk to you and shout at you with impunity? Does he have impunity because he is the assistant store manager? Isn’t leadership about leading by example? What gives him the right to treat me like this? Could it be because I am a black African? Could it be because I am a woman? Or god forbid I am both a black African and I am a woman. I spoke to another staff member about this man because this is not the first time he has had a go at me. This staff member said maybe it because he has two children. I have four children and I don’t treat people like he does. This is not acceptable. Dear Aldi Management Do I need to prove my worthiness and self worth every time I meet the intimidation and bullying tactics employed by this man. Is this the culture you guys are promoting in your stores. If he can treat me like this a random stranger at the check out how is he going to treat his colleagues especially when he is promoted from assistant to full manager.",2022-09-06T09:59:03.000Z,,,,,,,,,1,ProductReview.com.au,ALDI,4

Paul S.,"Sydney, NSW",Very poor customer service,2 out of 5 stars,"One instance at the Bonnyrigg store, a team member walked between myself and the product shelving whilst I was attempting to select a product. No ""excuse me"" or apology for cutting me off, he just walked on past oblivious to what he'd done.Another instance at the same store. This particular day I had to use the hand baskets, as I had misplaced my trolley token. Struggling with 2x heavy baskets at the checkout. It wasn't until I had repacked the baskets and was about to leave the store that a team member screamed at me at the top of her voice ...""you can't take the basket outside..."". I had every intention of returning them after I packed my car. There was no offer of assistance (e.g. empty cartons, apology, etc.) just a disrespectful rant from the checkout. Aldi either needs to revisit their customer service training, or employ team members that have previous customer service (retail) experience. A team member screaming at an unsuspecting customer at the top of their voice, in front of a shop full of other customers, is not what call ""good customer service"". I'm going to Woolies today. It'll probably cost me more, be it only for the higher level of checkout service, it will be worth it.",2022-08-28T01:48:04.000Z,,,,,,,,,2,ProductReview.com.au,ALDI,4

Bruce H,,Too many stars - pathetic non customer focused retailer,1 out of 5 stars,"Aldi are a retailer with exceptionally poor customer service.If you buy a bulky 'special buy' from the store expect no assistance to load such a heavy bulky item onto a trolley. Do not expect to be able to collect such an item from the receiving dock. Just struggle yourself, as Aldi are more concerned about your cash than customers. If this bulky item is faulty gain expect no assistance. I fully except buying items is the customers responsibility - however if the item is faulty, I believe the retailer is required to assist in the return ...of said item. It is called "" Duty of Care"" Aldi do not have a customer service contact phone number - just a web form - which times out after 5 minutes; hence its impossible to provide or share your negative experiences. If you purchase a new product and you require a spare part do to an initial failure, you deal with their agent, Action Spares - and equally pathetic non customer focused entity, you must sign a waiver to say you will accept a refurbished - second hand part - Really!! is this acceptable for a new product particularly during these pandemic times - you will also receive an email saying the part may take up to 28 days to be received. True, I could have asked for a refund however I would then have to borrow a suitable vehicle and incur additional costs to return the item. In short, pathetic retailer with a care factor of zero!!

Dean,,Aldi Dim Sims are TERRIBLE !,1 out of 5 stars,"The Aldi dim sims have deteriorated badly over the past 2 - 3 years. They are ALWAYS squashed in the bag (frozen), with the contents oozing out of each dim sim. They now reek of raw onion and have a strong raw onion flavour, even after steaming for a long time. It seems like they perhaps changed providers a few years ago - and the badly reduced quality is now evident. It’s now a sloppy, badly produced, poorly tasting product that badly brings down the Aldi brand name.",2022-06-22T00:19:32.000Z,,,,,,,,,1,ProductReview.com.au,ALDI,5

Luiys Reviews ,,You get what you pay for,3 out of 5 stars,"I remember going to ALDI about 15 years ago, products were cheap and high quality and the beer was good. It gave the duopoly Coles and Woolworths a run for their money. Now ALDIs standards have fallen or gone stale, the fruit and vegies aren’t good, the meat is dubious, the beer is not good, the checkouts are long and time consuming etc. Coles and Woolworths have lifted their standards like better store layouts with Improved Fresh food sections and they have self service checkouts which save time and staffing costs. ALDIs limited time products ...which if your lucky, can be good which tempts you to keep coming back. The biggest problem is ALDI’s business strategy is designed for Europe and has problems with Australia and the US because customer service and understanding the community is vital for any business to survive in the long run. Even the American supermarket giant Costco knows how Australia works than ALDI does.",2022-05-17T01:44:28.000Z,,,,,,15,,6,3,ProductReview.com.au,ALDI,6

Divine Justice,,People need to be aware that we are being told lies. The quality is not there so how cheap could cheap be?,1 out of 5 stars,"I have read many of the reviews presented by people herein. I have to admit that they are spot on. I am still very surprised that no one in ALDI management would take their time to read and take is seriously but then, could we argue that we are a minority? They claim to save 1500 a years? That would equate to 28.84 dollars a week. Big deal? When: as a guy put downwards regarding the meat quality and fat content, he is spot on. There is another user stating about the tuna and ruining a $ 20.00 meal. Well the tuna in spring water is just like pap...er, horrible. The whole normal fresh chickens are not good in odour and flavour. You need to buy the free range. So, in saying all this, where is the 28.84 dollars a week saving? Will buy me an Aston Martin ? I then end up going to Woolworths where they take advantage but the compared to Aldi the majority of the food taste and aroma as such is different. It is really sad as we need a balance to keep the others honest, somehow but it is not happening. Whatever they want to protrude as "" price"" , then what exactly is the advantage? I just had to throw away the apples my wife purchased at Aldi. They have no flavour and no idea from which tree they ever came from either? Fresh red salmon, is 10 out of 10...........but the difference in price with Woolworths is not gigantic. I still buy with a lot of care a few things. Consistency is not there either.

Michael H.,,Tuna Ocean Rise Yellow Fin chunk tuna in spring water,1 out of 5 stars,"Aldi tuna used to be chunks like Sirena. Opened a can tonight and threw it into my pasta and killed a $20 family meal with crushed tuna. If I wanted cheap tuna I would have paid less and gone to Coles or Woolies home brand. There meat has also become 25-40% more expensive and has more fat than before so I'd say 40-60% more expensive. There fruit and vegetables are also of a lesser quality, apples lower grade and don't get me started on the zucchini and other fruit and vegetables. Who wants huge oversized items, certainly not your majors who are... charging more for better quality. I could go on forever but check out their weekly specials, can be had for a cheaper price if you look around. Don't get sucked in, Big W and Kmart are probably cheaper for better quality. Don't get me wrong I used to buy 10% of my groceries 10 years ago from Aldi then went to 80% but have now gone back to 50%.

Burgman,,Heavy Duty Tile and Grout Cleaner,5 out of 5 stars,"Have previously used expensive professional/commercial grout cleaners in that are hard to find and reek of nasty chemicals. Saw this at Aldi this morning and I thought for $4.49 I’d give it a crack.Wow. This product knocked the ball out of the park. INSTANT results. I didn’t let it sit for five minutes, just sprayed it on and got my faithful Tek hard bristled toothbrush out and the dirt brushed off with one stroke.Of all the cleaning jobs that need doing around the house, this is by far the most satisfying as you get instant results and it co...mpletely changes the look of a room. I cannot speak more highly of this product. So easy to use and so fast. No scrubbing, just a matter of using a bristle brush to dislodge the dirt that the spray has loosened. Great stuff! If you’re selling your home, make sure you do this first. If you’re renting and have a dreaded inspection coming up, this is a must. Clean grout has an amazing positive effect on the general appearance and cleanliness of a house. You don’t realise how disgusting your grout is until you see the clean version beside it. Don’t hesitate to wonder about this Aldi gem - grab it while it’s in stock because the secret is out and they fly off the shelves. This is not an everyday item and was available late March.

I only picked up the mistake after when I paid when I checked the docket . I ask the check out operator who was actually staff manager named [Name Removed] if they have service desk so mistake can be rectified. He told me in a loud and angry voice that they don’t, but I have to go to back at the end of line and wait in que all over again when he serves all other customers before ...me. I naturally reacted that it hardly seems fair as it was not mine mistake or change of my mind but either systems or operator if he didn’t select correct item, he yelled even louder that it is stores policy that I go to the back of the line, I told him that I have never ever anywhere else been treated like that before and that I will not give him good review. He didn’t seem to care whatsoever. Anyway I found another check out with less people in a que and was served with respect and money refunded, yet no apology of any kind.

Lana,,Where customer service and ALDI policy,1 out of 5 stars,"I had a very unpleasant experience at ALDI, Southland. I have purchased various groceries including 700g Cage Eggs (2 boxes). At the register (#3) I asked the price of these eggs (on printed receipt), the response was $3.59 ea. I said that the price is $3.49. I have been told just to pay for groceries and if it wrong, they will refund it.Yes, I was right about the price. I went back and show him the photo with advertised price. He took my receipt without saying anything and disappeared for over 5 minutes. After return he mumbled something (I d...id not hear and understood anything), took my 2 boxes of eggs and refunded the whole amount. I said that the price is wrong and according to ALDI’s policy, the product in this case should be free. I said that I want the eggs back. Then he said that the manager allows to refund 0.59 c for each box and I repeated about the free product. He was rude and wanted to rid of me asap. It hard to believe that the Manager of the store does not know or follow ALDI’s policy (If a regular product scans at a price higher than that displayed, you are entitled to receive the first item free. All subsequent items will be charged at the lower price). It’s a shame that the customer service at many ALDI stores is getting worth. It was one of my favourite supermarkets.

It has components that need to be slid (with thin metal tabs) into 2 sides of the main beams which would not slide in to the tabs not matter what I did. I would get one or ...2 in, but never all. I tried gently tapping with a rubber mallet and dowel, but as these parts are so thin and flimsy they just bend and mangle making it even more impossible to connect them. After 45 mins of complete an utter frustration, I took apart the small amount I had assembled and put all of it straight into a skip.

UpYours,,Why wear face masks? Why even have public health directives?,1 out of 5 stars,"Since covid commenced, I obviously still have to go shopping. The various health directions in the ACT are clear and binding. Wearing face masks is nothing new as is how to wear them. Over the past six months, I've walked into ALDI in Amaroo and staff were either not wearing any face masks, or a mask around their neck, or a mask merely covering their mouth but not their nose. Health directives require face masks to properly cover both mouth and nose. I've informed ALDI management on numerous occasions of staff not following health directions. B...ut nothing ever changes. On 28 December 2021, the guy at checkout 1 had his nose fully exposed. The mask was merely hanging over his mouth and chin. When I pointed out that he wasn't wearing his mask over his nose, he gave a smart-crap response: ""Have you checked-in with the covid-app?"" I find such a smart-crap come-back inappropriate... and yes, I did check-in with the covid app and I was wearing my face mask correctly - he wasn't. Despite making a complaint last year, on 3 January 2022, another employee was also serving people with a mask merely covering his mouth and not his nose. The purpose of wearing a surgical mask is not to prevent staff from getting covid (although that might help a little) but it is to reduce staff exhaling viral loads should they be covid positive. That is why wearing the mask only covering the mouth is useless as staff can exhale the virus through their nose. A German online newspaper published a very interesting interactive image where you could choose the size of a room, how many people wore masks and how long people were in that room for.

Kristel,"Northern Region, NSW","Customer service is dead at Coles Armidale, NSW",1 out of 5 stars,"Yesterday at work people were complaining about the lack of serviced checkouts at our local Armidale NSW Coles. I decided to see for myself so, this morning I did my weekly grocery shop at Coles only to find that customer service is officially dead at Coles, Armidale. The only serviced checkout was the 12 items or less checkout. One man with a large trolley full of groceries was having to unload his trolley, scan each item and then repack his groceries. Though he was obviously struggling, no help was forthcoming from the staff who just seemed t...o be standing around. An elderly woman with a small trolley of groceries was unable to use the self serve checkout so went through the 12 or less checkout to the obvious annoyance of those behind her. I think Coles must be trying to differentiate themselves from ALDI and WOOLWORTHS by providing no customer service at high prices. On the way home I popped into Woolworths to pick up the items I couldn't find at Coles and couldn't help but notice how much busier they were than Coles.

Kristel,"Northern Region, NSW","Customer service is dead at Coles Armidale, NSW",1 out of 5 stars,"Yesterday at work people were complaining about the lack of serviced checkouts at our local Armidale NSW Coles. I decided to see for myself so, this morning I did my weekly grocery shop at Coles only to find that customer service is officially dead at Coles, Armidale. The only serviced checkout was the 12 items or less checkout. One man with a large trolley full of groceries was having to unload his trolley, scan each item and then repack his groceries. Though he was obviously struggling, no help was forthcoming from the staff who just seemed t...o be standing around. An elderly woman with a small trolley of groceries was unable to use the self serve checkout so went through the 12 or less checkout to the obvious annoyance of those behind her. I think Coles must be trying to differentiate themselves from ALDI and WOOLWORTHS by providing no customer service at high prices. On the way home I popped into Woolworths to pick up the items I couldn't find at Coles and couldn't help but notice how much busier they were than Coles.

I see sausages with more air pockets than meat filling....or with untied and exploding ends, scotch fillet 2packs, where one piece looks like a cut but when you open the packaging you realise its been that... POORLY cut and squashed together to look like a full piece and priced at 30 dollars like a piece of scotch, yet actually resembles something more similar to sausage meat or a cut that could have been made into stirfry strips or diced casserole meat. Kievs that have white rubber stuff form on the outside whilst cooking that I have never seen before. Spefically labelled winglettes that have damaged drummettes, still attached spare ribs and skin off cuts that should have gone into the bi products line, disguised in the packaging by the marinade. Milk bottles that literally split in corner seams or still have the finger hole piece stuck inside. Its just dissapointing because as the prices for all your products rise with the cost of living.........the quality is not rising with it and something needs to be done or the prices need to drop again because i find this insanely unacceptable and for a major outlet, the upmost pride should be taken in the packaging, presentation, and quality of the product that have the Coles name and label on them.",2022-11-23T05:24:22.000Z,,,,,,,,,2,ProductReview.com.au,Coles Supermarkets,2

About 80% of the checkouts at Coles Earlwood are now self-checkouts, half of which are commonly closed because a staff member needs to monitor you checking out. Is there an actual need for the checkouts to be SELF-checkouts when a staff member needs to be present? And again, this method of checking out, alienates elderly customers who would not know how to scan the items, how to bag them, or to scan the bags along the way, etc. To sum up my feedback to you, Coles, your vision is to become, ""the most trusted retailer in Australia,"" and I believe that you have failed in your approach.",2022-11-18T11:28:57.000Z,2,2,1,,False,,,,1,ProductReview.com.au,Coles Supermarkets,2

Fred123,,Coles. The Feral Food People?,1 out of 5 stars,"I recently returned some pears to our nearest Coles, which is at Mount Sheridan in Cairns, for the third time this year as they had once again failed to ripen after many days on the kitchen bench top as they had either been picked too green and/or had been in cold storage for too long, and they developed rotten brown spots instead.On the last occasion, the girl at the Customer Disservice Desk said that she had worked at other local Coles where the “managers” refused to refund defective “fresh” produce but she processed my refund.On 03.11.2022..., I bought 2 x “Coles” Kensington Pride mangoes for $2.50 each and another 4 on 05.11.2022 on “special” at $2.00 each. None of them developed the usual sweet mango aroma and the 2 my wife tried a couple of days ago were neither juicy or sweet. The skins on all of them were starting to wrinkle without ripening properly. I took the remaining 4 mangoes and the 2 Coles receipts to the Customer Disservice Desk yesterday for a refund. The one person who was doing the express checkout, the Disservice Desk enquiries, and selling tobacco decided that she needed to ask a person at another checkout then returned to say she had to call the manager. After some 10 minutes, an individual with a bad attitude finally arrived and I explained once again what the problem was. She retorted by asking why I had taken so long to return them, to which I replied that we had waited for them to ripen. I also said that ripe mangoes should smell sweet, and be sweet and juicy, and these ones were not fit for purpose.

costly mistake,,"No Customer service at Coles Supermarket, Westfield Helensvale.",1 out of 5 stars,"The self service registers are a nightmare to use because they are extremely sensitive to any number of cu...stomer interactions and will stop working for many reasons, sometimes it can be as insignificant as nudging your plastic shopping bag!! The customer is then left trying to catch the attention of the lone staff member servicing the area. In my case the staff member was engaging in some well meaning social interaction with a couple of elderly customers which meant that I was left waiting and waiting. until I gave up and left. There is no point in providing a self service facility unless it can be made easy, simple and fast to use by any first time customer. If this is not an option, management should insist that staff on duty are there to help customers and to focus on the job. In summary, forget going in early for a quick shop at Coles Helensvale. At 9.00am there was only the express register manned, and the self service area had 1 staff member who was tied up socialising with a couple I can only assume were her friends as there was no concern for any other customer waiting. If Coles supermarkets are intent on providing no customer help at all, at the very least they should create an automated system that is fail safe, otherwise what is the point.

We thought about leaving with no groceries, but that would mean doing the whole shopping process again the next day, which I couldn't manage. So, we had no ch...oice but to manage the scanning and packing ourselves. It was a long, exhausting experience and I was in pain for days afterwards. Now I know that if I need to buy more than two things, I need to go to Woolies.",2022-10-16T23:20:14.000Z,,,,,,,,,1,ProductReview.com.au,Coles Supermarkets,3

MarkandLynn,,Coles conscious attack on the Aged and Disabled.,1 out of 5 stars,"Yes . After droughts, Covid, floods, and rampid cost of living burdens, Coles has commenced their commercial attack on the aged and the disabled.This is a unambiguous campaign that in my mind , is both thoughless and predatory.Imagine after 15,000 dead by Covid a distinct possibility in Australia in 12 months most being the aged and frail.Coles takes it one step further.Coles is removing their "" small purchase"" express , assisted check outs.Who are the demographics that rely on them most.The aged, the frail, the disabled.Removing them altogether.IndooroopillyApologies from staff whom asked us to bring this to broader attention....Coles are in my mind anything but community minded. When 15 billion is not enough and they turn on the weak and frail, its time to cast them out. Refuse them as you would anyone or any business that burdens and withdraws fundamental supports for the frail and vunerable in our society. Cast them out for the pretense of freezing prices ( just like woolworths ) after the initial 3 months of exponential rampant price increases and product shrinkage. Then pretend to freeze prices after the inflation. This is Coles world. Wait until they reduce your range choice. Wait until they tell you to use your phone to scan your items as you shop, with your smartphone. Wait until you have to pack yourself. Coles is already turning on society. Today its the aged ,frail and disabled. Tomorrow it will be much worse and yes, when you self serve, your aiding there agenda and hurting those you should have empathy for.",2022-10-09T05:31:37.000Z,,,,,,12,,10,1,ProductReview.com.au,Coles Supermarkets,3

Ruth F,,So unimpressed Westfield Helensvale Store/Online Delivery,1 out of 5 stars,"Basically the dasher did not collect my cold food/frozen food part of the order, and I have now officially spent 50 mins of my time trying to sort that out....In that time I've had to ring Coles twice and DD twice and then ring Coles Customer Service for a refund, as no-one would give me a redelivery. The dasher had basically finished work and because that dasher wasn't available, DD wouldn't book another delivery. Ringing Coles Helensvale was a nightmare. I had to ring repeatedly as at times they wouldn't answer their phone, and when I asked to speak to a Manager, he kept calling me darling every 5 words or so (that impressed me, NOT). He told me to ring DD (AGAIN) and then eventually DD rang Coles Helensvale and my only option was to ring Coles Customer Service/Care for a refund. I realise it was DD mistake, at least I presume it was, as I don't know the procedure at that end, but it should be foolproof at that end, in that there should be some alert about collecting separate cold items to the main delivery. I now need to attend store to get the rest of my order. This was a ridiculous situation of blaming each other and NO-ONE wanting to resolve it properly. So unimpressed and yes this will be posted all around social media. Thanks Coles Helensvale, you have NOT won a fan. Perhaps try to look after your customers when something like this occurs instead of making them run around to sort it out.

And if the people you are holding up in the queue protest, advise them to stop and check their recepts before leaving too.",2022-07-06T11:12:58.000Z,,,,,,4,,2,1,ProductReview.com.au,Coles Supermarkets,5
Amanda,,Rotten Chicken,1 out of 5 stars,"On Friday 24th June 2022, I purchased a 2kg bag of chicken legs from Coles Elizabeth store. On arriving home today, Monday 27th June 2022 to prepare my families dinner, I open the bag of chicken to be met with a rotten smell. I then check the expiry on the chicken as I had just bought it Friday, the use by date was 27/06/22. The chicken was refrigerated the whole time it was in my possession. I wouldnt dare to feed to my family, I am now left with NO Dinner to feed my family. I am not happy. I did not keep my receipt, however did scan my flybys card at the time of sale.

But where did Coles Go wrong. There is hardly anything on shelf. You can't just blame everything on COVID and delivery. Being just across the road from Coles I hear the delivery early hours of the morning unpacking the stock. But Coles say there out of stock. All my favourite food has become discontinued. Not from the company but Coles has decided to discontinue. Mould has been found in cake's from the bakery. When I've told... them they just say sorry and still the bakery brings in mouldy cakes. This is not only a health hazard but a lack of care problem. Many staff don't want to work. I never see a smile like I used too. The checkout staff have become judgmental and somewhat rude.

I didn't know what to do (and I was not dresse...d for shopping) so I asked to speak to the manager. Expecting they'd get the alcohol. He said what I ordered wasn't available, I said but, the monies paid for it. He said there was nothing he could do they had an affiliation with Liquorland across the road. I said, what about if I haven't got the money. He said I'd be refunded. I said 'when, it's 3 hours before Easter, you've taken the money out of my a/c what am I going to do for Easter, and, how do I know I'll be refunded'. He said with a smile, 'Coles will refund it'. I became irate and showed it. Facts their statement showed $30 less than that taken out of my bank. Witness saw there were items missing, and also I read there were items unavailable at the time the CSO picked out groceries, but, the items missing that were not those 'unavailable' list. Witnesses also noticed the bags smelt, this meant there had been sometime the seafood had be sitting for that to have happened. I'd placed the order around 11:30 pm the previous night. Why couldn't they have phoned me when they realised they couldn't get the items and arranged for alternative ones. Why couldn't they have given me a refund at the time of pick-up. How could they have left a person in such disarray. I explained guests were coming the next day and I had no money for alcohol.

The problem with this enduring excuse is that most people are at worst, sick for 3-4 days and are thereafter well again and can/do go back to work. So I rang Coles' so-called customer care line to articulate my frustration at the fact that their website gives misleading stock levels which do not reflect actual store availability.

Margo,,Checkout Operator refused to pack my groceries,1 out of 5 stars,"Not too happy yesterday when Emma refused to pack my groceries into my trolley bags at Coles at Sunshine Plaza Maroochydore. I noticed the customer in front of me had bought about six big plastic bags for her groceries. Are the checkout operators now pressuring customers into buying Coles bags? She said it was because I had trolley bags and she couldn't pack into them. I have never had trouble before and have been using these for about three years and this is the first time someone has refused to pack into them. I showed her how to hook the han...dle over two of the loops and she still refused to pack them. If this is going to be a 'norm', I will start to shop elsewhere. I am happy to say that I have never used a Coles bag and definitely do not intend to start now even if they were free., https://au.oceaniabiz.com/queensland/coles-maroochydore-37090",2022-02-17T22:49:24.000Z,,,,,,3,,,1,ProductReview.com.au,Coles Supermarkets,7

How can they justify such a huge increase? And it not just large price rises either. Coles brand Tasty Cheese was $4 for 24 slices. Now $4.40. And they're doing it across the board. Yet if I want to buy a slab of coke I'm gauranteed to save more than half price. Same deal on chips, chocolate, lollies, icecream and all other unhealthy junk food. Don't expect to eat healthily at a reasonable price at Coles. And Woolworths are no better! They just price match the same specials at Coles and offer no better value.

Debz,,Poor Deli Service across multiple NSW stores,1 out of 5 stars,"Hi, Over the last 3 months or so I have been refused by many staff to slice your Primo Chili Coated Salami. Eg Xmas Eve - Attended Mudgee, approx 5 staff in the deli, approx 4.30 pm and I was told they would not slice the meat as the slicer had gone home, so I then drove to Bathurst approx 2 hours away, only to be told the same, that they would not shave or slice this for me as the Slicers were off, I then traveled through to Goulburn a further 5 hours, only to be told the Deli is shut but that they had no one who would slice any meat anyway. A...pprox 2 weeks before this I attended Batemans Bay Coles at approx 5 pm as well as Muswellbrook, again where staff refused to slice any Salami. Take your signs down as this is false advertising, and given that this is regular practice, this is the most disgusting customer service and I will notify Primo as Coles seems to have exclusive rights to this product. I live rurally where it is no less than 1.5 hours to do any shopping and to continue to get this level of service is appalling. Your staff needs training or you need to take your statements down which are on every Coles wall which states that ""You will slice Fresh Meat"". This is deceptive and misleading advertising, and wondering what the legal position is on this? It seems to be that none of your NSW staff have any interest in good customer service at $32 a KG, just curious if COLES Head office is aware how much money is being lost through nasty Deli Service??",2022-01-03T11:10:07.000Z,,,,,,2,,1,1,ProductReview.com.au,Coles Supermarkets,7

The service desk had issue with changing the price, as per the label, but called over the manager ‘Grant’ to assist. Grant stated that it was a third party item and he would not honour the price as displayed and... I would have to pay full price. In the end I wasted nearly 20 minutes just to be told the price on the shelf was not the price you pay at the register.

Harry,,Zero customer service with half a dozen employees just standing around & looking.,1 out of 5 stars,I stopped at WA Singleton store the other day to buy some frozen foods and took my items to a checkout but was told to go to another one as this was closing down. I moved to line up at the other checkout only to be told it too was closing down and to move for another one . At least 2 other customers in the same situation trying to pay for their items and not a single checkout opened. Meanwhile 3 staff were standing and chatting near the self checkouts and one of them pointed to them asking us to use them. Also 2 more staff were at the self chec...kout exit checking customer receipts yet not one of them willing to open up a checkout for customers. After almost 5 minutes of trying to have a checkout open one of the customers decided to leave the trolley with goods behind and walk out of the store. I was just about to follow her but finally one of the staff opened up the 12 items or less counter so we could pay for the items. I understand that the stores are trying to increase profits by getting all customers to use self serve but customers are not getting any discounts for using them and there is no saving for shareholders either when at least 5 staff are hanging around the checkouts and getting paid but refusing to serve waiting customers. Needless to say I will take the advice of one of the other customers in line behind me and if I can avoid it will never set foot in another Woolworths again. Aldi may not be an Australian company but has cheaper grocery prices and is not pushing customers into using self serve checkouts.,2022-12-20T04:38:47.000Z,1,,1,False,False,14,,24,1,ProductReview.com.au,Woolworths Physical store,1

Harry,,Zero customer service with half a dozen employees just standing around & looking.,1 out of 5 stars,I stopped at WA Singleton store the other day to buy some frozen foods and took my items to a checkout but was told to go to another one as this was closing down. I moved to line up at the other checkout only to be told it too was closing down and to move for another one . At least 2 other customers in the same situation trying to pay for their items and not a single checkout opened. Meanwhile 3 staff were standing and chatting near the self checkouts and one of them pointed to them asking us to use them. Also 2 more staff were at the self chec...kout exit checking customer receipts yet not one of them willing to open up a checkout for customers. After almost 5 minutes of trying to have a checkout open one of the customers decided to leave the trolley with goods behind and walk out of the store. I was just about to follow her but finally one of the staff opened up the 12 items or less counter so we could pay for the items. I understand that the stores are trying to increase profits by getting all customers to use self serve but customers are not getting any discounts for using them and there is no saving for shareholders either when at least 5 staff are hanging around the checkouts and getting paid but refusing to serve waiting customers. Needless to say I will take the advice of one of the other customers in line behind me and if I can avoid it will never set foot in another Woolworths again. Aldi may not be an Australian company but has cheaper grocery prices and is not pushing customers into using self serve checkouts.,2022-12-20T04:38:47.000Z,1,,1,False,False,14,,24,1,ProductReview.com.au,Woolworths Physical store,1

QLDZDR,,Keeping the Social Distance in stores,3 out of 5 stars,"November 11 (yes Rememberance Day) 2021, Queensland has eased the Covid19 mask mandate, but social distancing and hygiene considerations are still in place.Queensland Health has still recommended that individuals keep masks on faces indoors because social distancing space can be invaded by the unthinking (or Covid deniers) crowd in an instant. Full marks to the Woolies staff, they are all wearing masks and the clear acrylic screens around the staff in the checkout are still there. The social distancing dots on the floor in checkout lines a...re still visible. So why does an unmasked woman (one we have seen unmasked in shops before) decide to stand behind us. She is putting her stuff on the conveyor as the conveyor moves forward slowly. We only have a few things (unusual for us). We are standing on our DOT and the person in front is still paying. Behind my back the unmasked woman behind decides to move into my personal space to lean in and rearrange her stuff on the conveyor. She touched me. I turned around and said ""Excuse me, keep your distance"" she stands on her toes to object, so I reminded her about the DOTS. Yes I have been vaccinated, but I don't want to be exposed to unnecessary risks because getting sick means not being able to work and everything else that flows on from that.

The reality is that 'For your convenience' means 'For Woolworths convenience.' I prefer to use cash, so the setup definitely isn't convenient for me. Other supermarkets (yes, Coles, I'm talking about you) manage to have multiple machines that take cash or card, so why is it so difficult for Woolworths to do it?

I live 100 KLM round trip. Extra $20 petrol to take the apples back. No way.I often ignore it because of all the cost and effort. But now I'm on... product review I might as well complain about the many times the dockets are hard to read, which once cost me a couple of hundred dollars, when I went to claim on mouse rebate from the Government. ( Still got mouse rebate receipts.) Government paid all of my Coles receipts for mouse bait purchases ($350 from memory) but Woolworths couple receipts they would not pay out in due to being unreadable. Even though I could still faintly see date/purchase/price, if mouse bait purchases. Can't blame Government for not paying out, as receipts all got scanned /photocopied before sending off to claim. So I lost out money wise. This really goes back years for faint print on dockets at Woolworths. Never had it, or noticed it at Coles ever. All their dockets clear print that I can remember. Now it's another problem - Hands, apples, bench, mobile phone all sticky apple juice. More cleaning up I guess. Woolworths you MUST of known these apples weren't fit for eating.

Catherine b.,,"Plastic trolleys unhygienic, mouldy and a breeding found for germs and disease.",3 out of 5 stars,"I was at a store in Northern NSW today and used a plastic trolley for the first time. The trolleys were newly introduced to this particular store and were already grotty and mould was showing the first stages of growth. With lots of areas for grime to gather on every part of the trolley, in this case it already was, these will soon be an festering breeding ground that can make people sick. All of the east coast of Australia from Sydney upwards, suffers from humidity and mould and I can see a disaster of suable sicknesses being contracted from t...he trolleys themselves. Stainless steel does not breed mould and does not harbour germs. How are these plastic trolleys going to be kept hygienic and clean? With Covid still a threat, with humidity and mould, these trolleys are a breeding ground for anything that can fester. I don't know what I am going to do if all woolworths supermarkets start using these trolleys. I will have to stop using the supermarket altogether. They are poorly designed for hygiene purposes. People who live down south in Australia don't understand the mold issues suffered in humid areas. If you put your handbag onto a mouldy surface, mould spores open up and spread, you then take your bag into your car and home, this puts fresh mould spores into these new spaces. These trolleys may have been a good idea for the enviroment, but they are not a good idea for peoples health and hygiene.",2022-11-05T09:12:48.000Z,,,,,,4,,,3,ProductReview.com.au,Woolworths Physical store,2

D S.,,Here to pick your pocket,1 out of 5 stars,"After writing my review that was posted on Google.com.au, the rele...vant staff member virtually immediately returned the price of the item to the more reasonable figure. What we are seeing each an every time we enter these corporate giant stores is the same behavior; as an example, within a 3 month period the Woolworths branded(the Woolworths Essentials and slightly more visually appealing Woolworths brands appear to be dissolving to be replaced for one by the newer even more colorful Bell Farms which they charge a heck of a lot more money for) Australian Steakhouse Chips were $2.00/kg three to four months ago, the price then increased to $2.40/kg a 20% increase in price then only a matter of possibly a month ago the price increased again to $3.00/kg again yet another 25% increase. Another example of the corporate/shareholder dividend driven greed of this monopolizing, what I believe to be price fixing practices(even if it is in a local proximity basis, as for years in different suburbs in South East Queensland when the major grocery suppliers are within a relatively short walking distance of one another; I have been in the other major grocery suppliers outlet to see Woolworths staff with writing pad and pen writing down products and prices and I’ve seen the other major grocery suppliers staff members walking through Woolworths stores doing the same thing. I think they are sensible enough not to be in collusion with each other, but why fight a price war when they can both win by not trying to compete but by equally gouging. This is why aside from promotional items there is no price difference between Woolworths and its greatest competitor) we are subjected to paying is Gravox Traditional Gravy 120g; I was lost for words other an expletives when on the 5th August 2022 the price of this item had jumped from the regular Woolworths rip-off price of $3.80/unit to $5.00, again a 31.57% price increase. Yet, I checked with a major online supplier this morning to compare prices confirming yet again Woolworths is doing their best to bend me over the checkout.

I have shopped at the Para Hills store on 3 occasions in the past 2 weeks (I have spent over $700 with these shops) and I must say I have been completely unsatisfied with some of the staff on 2 of the occasions. First shop , I was told to get out of the way of the freezer, by a night fill staff member, as I was in the way of him filling the freezer with new stock. I wanted to complain, as he was very rude as he told me to get out of the way, but I thought ab...out my time in retail and thought he was just trying to do his job. The other occasion I wish to complain about is the check out operator I had, she was rude, had no eye contact and didn't speak a word to me, until she snapped at me if I wished to use my credit of my shop. I requested if there was any fixem's left. I got yelled at NO. The only good thing I discovered in my in my 3 shops, was a lovely male checkout operator, with very big dark hair (afro) I am so sorry I didn't get his name, but he was wonderful, and he is the only reason I gave the review a 3 otherwise it would be a 1, which is terrible.",2022-08-10T11:56:42.000Z,,,,,,,,,3,ProductReview.com.au,Woolworths Physical store,4

No longer express, either go here or go and queue up.I requested to speak to the Manager and voiced my opinion ...to him that I only wanted 2 items, I don't use self serve checkouts and I should not have to queue up with loaded trolleys for 2 items. He claims it is so they can manage queues more efficiently now as they are all visible in one line , not split up with a counter in the middle and checkouts either side. He thanked me for the feedback. Also the assistant at the self service was of little assistance to me. She said move your bag from the left side to this side and scan your item and walked off to chat with another employee. That was it.

Because it was on special at $6.50 marked down from $7.50.I went through the self service checkout and the items scanned at the full (non discounted) price.I called the store attendant over, the one who is there to make sure people don't steal from them. I told her about the pricing error and she wouldn't take me word for it and asked someone to verify that I was tell...ing the truth. After a period of waiting I asked her if I should go and take a photo of the item to prove that I wasn't trying to rip off Woolworths to the tune of $2.00 as I had purchased two packs. I returned with the photographic evidence which still wasn't acceptable until a store employee had independently verified that I was in fact correct. The most disturbing thing is that once it was verified she changed my order to reflect the true price but did not note it down to change it in the system. It will just continue to over charge customers who buy that product. When did customer service at Woolworths become so diabolically poor? The prevailing attitude is that all customers are dishonest.

Brad D.,,Gone from bad to awful,2 out of 5 stars,"Was frequent shopper at local regional Woolworths Supermarket, but store has become a joke.Apart from being old, cramped and constantly understocked, the lack of competent staff has made every trip to this store an unpleasant one of late.Final straw today was when I went to use a WW gift card I received for giving feedback on an inferior Woolworths branded product.The checkout operator seemed to have no clue on how to process it and after multiple attempts and finally saying it must have been used already, luckily another team member stepped... in and showed her what she was doing wrong. I suffer from severe anxiety and this sort of experience is enough to set it off badly. PLEASE Woolworths either get a Manager for this store (Atherton Qld 4883) who is competent in training staff correctly, or step in and correct its many failings. I for one will not be returning. At least we have an IGA store as an alternative. Some of their products are a bit more expensive, but at least they are generally well stocked, have friendly competent staff and a buy local policy which means fresh local produce is sold there.

David H.,,Not Fresh,1 out of 5 stars,"I purchased a 3kg net of Oranges at Woolworths Katoomba on Fri 29 April. I opened them to use when I got home (within a couple of hours of purchase) and the first orange I took out had a large bad spot. I submitted a complaint to Woolworths the next morning but have had no response at all. I expected that the oranges would be covered by their fresh food guarantee, but they haven't even bothered to reply with an apology.On looking at the fine print of their 'Fresh or Free' guarantee I find that it does not cover packaged produce unless it is... marked with their fresh or free symbol. I guess a net of oranges is packaged (and I don't remember seeing any fresh or free symbol on it) so is not covered by their fresh food promise.

EVA,,Woolworths HUONVILLE,1 out of 5 stars,"Staff treat customers with contempt in this store. The store has been the subject of repeated complaints from the community. A new store manager has recently been appointed to the store to improve the toxic culture. The group manager committed to improving the store for locals in the rural area where there is no alternative large supermarket. I recently visited the store to see if improvements had been made.I found no change. Staff were reluctant to assist, grim and unfriendly. When I visited the fish counter and asked when the 'fresh' fish a...rrived, the staff did not know. I asked to speak to the store manager and was told there was no store manager on that day. I was then bossed around by a loud, highly-strung, defensive supervisor who was reluctant to answer the question and visibly irritated that I had asked it. She then went on confirm that the fish was six days old and that this was considered fresh. She then tried to excuse this by saying that it was on 'special' for this reason. I asked if there were any full-priced fresher fish available and was told that they had to use up the old fish first. I declined the purchase and narrowly avoided being run down by a store picker on my way out of the store. I no longer shop there and never will again. I now buy bulk from a competitor and purchase my vegetables from the farm gate. Defensive, nasty, unkind, unhelpful staff pushing stale products.

Greg P.,,Check your receipt carefully!,1 out of 5 stars,"My concern is they are robbing all the people that are too busy to check every line item on their receipts and seek a refund for the ove...rcharged amount.

If that was truly the case then all their competitors would be seeing the same issue with their new checkout operators too. Nope, I shop at all the major supermarket chains and it's only Woolworths that try to rip me off. Hello ACCC, are you hearing this? I would encourage everyone to check your recieipt before leaving the store and lodge a compalint with the ACCC for every occasion Woolworths attempts to defraud you. If enough people complain, it wont be long before the ACCC will be forced to look into this practice and have Woolworths fix the problem.

I knew prices were going up, but Woolies prices are going up in HUGE ways. Instant noodles, 25%. Soft drinks, bread.

I'm on a pension and am already looking at Charity organizations to supplement what I suspect is price gouging by Woolworths. Pies went from $4 to $6 in the space of two m...onths. One Woolworths worker, on being asked why, told me that she literally cried when she saw the pie prices as she has two teenage sons. Now, if someone who is WORKING at Woolies is in such despair I can only say that this is not the first time they've priced me out of being able to eat certain, once cheap and labelled ""Essential"" products but, it's the first time I've felt insulted by the incredible increase which means even the CHEAPEST products are out of my price range. Shame on Woolworths, shame. I'll be shopping around from here on in and not at their multinational corporation competitors because they all raise prices at the same time.

I’ve been buying the tinned cat tuna for over 10 years now… it’s always been between .79-.85c per tin. It’s always on the shelves during this so-called pandemic so stock is not an issue. However Woolworths now charge $1.50 for the same product. Coles however sell it for under .90c Everything has increased dramatically and without reason in this store… mince is a prime example. Budget mince is now at $16kg. Even gourmet private butchers don’t charge this much. Thieves in broad daylight.,2022-03-17T07:08:50.000Z,,,,,,58,,50,1,ProductReview.com.au,Woolworths Physical store,7
Tee,,Absolutely disappointed!!,1 out of 5 stars,I purchased a packet of brisket bone for my dogs last week. I buy them because brisket is a porous bone that dogs can sink their teeth into & in turn keep them in good condition. Never in my many past purchases of these bones have I had to cut out & throw away so much hard bone because it's not safe to feed my dog. Usually I am able to cut up the majority of the bones & give them to my dog but not this time. I'm really shocked that ive had to throw away 320grams of hard bone out of the 1.129kg overall weight. I've never ever had this happen before. I'm really disappointed,2022-03-16T11:01:21.000Z,,,,,,5,,2,1,ProductReview.com.au,Woolworths Physical store,7

I mentioned this to the person on duty. The following week I tried again with the same result. This time I managed to speak to the manager about the problem and offered a costless solution.

Fred123,,Woolies Customer Disservice.,1 out of 5 stars,"Woolies incompetence and stupidity is exceeded only by their arrogance and dishonesty.A few days ago, I went to the only Woolies store in Cairns that listed Purina Supercoat Chicken & Duck dry dog food as actually being in stock, as it is the only kibble that our little dog actually likes, but there was no stock.I went to another Woolies store which also had none but I bought a different variety which I later recalled he would not previously eat so I returned to the Woolies Customer Disservice Counter where a wet- behind-the-ears girl pointed... to a sign taped on top of the counter which she claimed stated that they do not do exchanges or refunds for change of mind purchases, but after a brief “chat”, she begrudgingly refunded my money. I then went to Coles who actually had the item I wanted despite failing to list it on their website. Yesterday, I took a photo of the sign on the Woolies Customer Disservice Counter and it does not mention refusing exchanges for change of mind purchases, as their website also does not. ""Exchanges We will happily provide an exchange where you have changed your mind about a product purchased from Woolworths provided that the product: is returned to us with a receipt within 30 days of purchase; is in its original condition, including with packaging; and has not been used and, if a perishable product, is not expired or within 2 days of expiry.""

John13,,Militant money grabbers with little regard for consumer rights.,1 out of 5 stars,"A few months ago, I returned 4 Hass avocados to... Woolworths Whitfords City WA as they were clearly diseased. The person who assisted me was polite but when it came to the refund and exchange, she curtly advised either or - not both. I asked to speak to the manager to which she replied she IS the manager. She added that she had NEVER heard of that policy. I accepted an exchange as by this time there was a queue. See the excerpt from the Woolworths returns policy: Woolworths Fresh or Free Guarantee ""The Woolworths Returns Policy applies in conjunction with our Fresh or Free Guarantee. Under our Fresh or Free Guarantee, we’ll refund AND replace any fresh food you're not happy with which is sold online or in-store."" See website: https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/discover/about-us/returns-policy On the 26/02/22 I returned a 175g packet of SMITHS Thinly Cut Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips. This product was outright disgusting - way too much salt & vinegar and overcooked. Initially, I was refused a refund but after the assistant consulted with his manager, was given the refund as a ""once off favour"" as ""Woolworths are changing their refunds policy"" in their words. And no ""change of mind"" would be entertained in future. Well, Mr. RIP-OFF Woolworths, this was NOT a change-of-mind return. And the ACCC clearly states that all returns are conducted from the point of sale. Furthermore, it appears that Woolworths Group Pty Ltd have forgotten the ACCC / Big W fiasco whereby Big W were fobbing off consumers who had issues with their Dyson appliances. Big W were not accepting returns, telling customers to deal direct with Dyson. The ACCC /Big W outcome is well documented and can be viewed on the ACCC website titled ""Big W will address customer complaints about faulty Dyson appliances."" dated 15th October 2019. The contemptuous and arrogant Woolworths Group Ltd clearly need to be reminded that the ACCC will take action against any BODY acting ultra vires - nor are they exempt from accountability. Given my adverse experiences, Woolworths are nothing but militant money grabbers with little regard for consumer rights.",2022-03-01T17:39:20.000Z,,,,,,76,,82,1,ProductReview.com.au,Woolworths Physical store,8

chrome.griffin77,"Illawarra, NSW",How does this company make so much money?,1 out of 5 stars,"I really cant understand how a supermarket chain of this size cannot get the basics right yet continue to make astronomical profits.The signage is totaly messed up making it extra hard to find things, the main signs tucked in the aisle so you have to walk up and down the whole store to read them.Tripping up over giant trolleys of stock left blocking aisle in the middle of the day.Constantly running out of budget brands so you have to buy the so called ""premium"" brand at 3X price.Bad positioning of foods that should go in the same space, but... instead are at either ends of the shop. Dirty rickety trolleys and baskets with vegetable leftovers stuck inside them make great places to put food in guys, thanks. A 2 per person limit on tiny box of painkillers despite THOUSANDS of boxes on the shelf, genius move there. And if you do eventually make it to the self serve checkout only half of them take cash, its nice squishing around people as they stand confused as to which machine they can use. Then the bags, you're expected to BUY a bag for $1 made outa some tent material cause they ran out of regular bags? My local shop even had a GIANT steel box like bunnings filled with crap cardboard boxes blocking half the checkout area. WHY DONT YOU HAVE BAGS??? REALLY?!?! horrible in store experience. But dont try to avoid it, buying online is MUCH MUCH worse, more than 24hrs to deliver 2 blocks away and it turned up in a taxi at 6pm after a whole bunch of confusion.

(no access to a car), while obviously taking COVID-related risks (I'm trying to minimise the time I spend out as everyone should be to stop the spread), only to find that there was none in stock (and there is no substitute for this item either). I explained the situation (inc. the website and the walk) and asked for a raincheck, only to be rudely brushed off. If I had taken a chance and it was not available I'd put it down to bad luck, but it was clearly noted as being 'in stock'. Seems that Woolies are really only interested in getting the punters in and not on responsibly managing a supply-chain crisis. If they were serious, they'd either keep their websites up to date or remove the function of finding whether stock is in your local store entirely - and they'd stop advertising specials that they cannot honour and don't intend to honour - or, on special items they'd offer rainchecks.
