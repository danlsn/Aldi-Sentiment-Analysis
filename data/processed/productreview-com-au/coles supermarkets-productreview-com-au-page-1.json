Next time I went into the supermarket to buy noodles, price had jumped more than ten percent. Hmmm! Also noticed that some of the 'specials' were the same price as listed normally. Hmmmm! Go to the other lot and you get the same sort of incompetence/gouging.  Neither of them restock shelves overnight, leaving aisles congested in the morning, and setting up artificial 'shortages'. If you have an Aldi or Lidl close by, just thank your lucky stars, and spare a thought for us poor morons who have to endure this TeedleDumb/TweedleDumber duopoly.",

The staff called there manager [Name Removed] who said he checked and there is no items in their stock at least for the last 4 weeks. He also offered to replace this item though. I told him that I am not there to expect a refund/ replacement but was there to convey that there can be items which are expired and with a request to review from their side as systems can have flaws. Manager- [Name Removed] was not ready to accept that there are expired items in their current stock. \nAfter this conversation, I moved in for other shopping in the store and my son observed there was a Bega Peanut butter bottle in the store with the same expire date as 15 Sep 2022. I took a photograph of it and also picked up the bottle and went to the counter again and asked to call [Name Removed] to show it to him since he was in a full denial earlier about the possibility of expired items in stock. [Name Removed] came with a different mindset this time and his first dialogue was '' see man, I don't want to be rude as this is a busy day today'' !!!!!! \nI asked - What's here to be rude, have I been rude. I am just requesting Coles to check for expired items, just wanted their acceptance on this and assurance to check their stock and nothing else... I had been very calm in my conversation throughout.\nBy then,[Name Removed]'s manager [Name Removed] came, he appeared to be a sensible person and when I told him same thing all over again and showed the expired bottle, he said that he accepted that systems can have flaws and will check if there are more such expired items. \nI was happy with [Name Removed]'s assurance as I just wanted this acceptance from Coles. No system can be perfect and there can be flaws in any system however with all this experience, it became evident that Coles staff (store lead/ manager etc.) need training to respect customer, understand the customer issues and to better deal with customers.",

I decided to see for myself so, this morning I did my weekly grocery shop at Coles only to find that customer service is officially dead at Coles, Armidale. The only serviced checkout was the 12 items or less checkout. One man with a large trolley full of groceries was having to unload his trolley, scan each item and then repack his groceries. Though he was obviously struggling, no help was forthcoming from the staff who just seemed to be standing around. An elderly woman with a small trolley of groceries was unable to use the self serve checkout so went through the 12 or less checkout to the obvious annoyance of those behind her. I think Coles must be trying to differentiate themselves from ALDI and WOOLWORTHS by providing no customer service at high prices.\nOn the way home I popped into Woolworths to pick up the items I couldn't find at Coles and couldn't help but notice how much busier they were than Coles. I think that trend will probably continue.",

I fed the birds with this product and even the birds did not consume them. In the packet it clearly states \"TRY IT.LOVE IT.
