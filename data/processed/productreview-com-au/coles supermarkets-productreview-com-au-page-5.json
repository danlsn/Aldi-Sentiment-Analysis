As if grocery prices were not high enough already!  The only explanation I received was that the operator was new and that this happens sometimes.  Is it a training issue? A technical problem with their scanners?  Or just a blatant disregard for their customers?  Coles only refunds the overpayment to those who take the time to return to the store.  You are still charged for the original item, so I don't see any incentive for them to take more care and do better.  Check your receipts before leaving the checkout.  And if the people you are holding up in the queue protest, advise them to stop and check their recepts before leaving too.",

I then check the expiry on the chicken as I had just bought it Friday, the use by date was 27/06/22.  The chicken was refrigerated the whole time it was in my possession.  I wouldnt dare to feed to my family, I am now left with NO Dinner to feed my family.  I am not happy.  I did not keep my receipt, however did scan my flybys card at the time of sale.  I don't know what I paid for the chicken but would expect to be compensated for my inconvenience.\nLet's see if I get any response.",

There is hardly anything on shelf. You can't just blame everything on COVID and delivery. Being just across the road from Coles I hear the delivery early hours of the morning unpacking the stock. But Coles say there out of stock. All my favourite food has become discontinued. Not from the company but Coles has decided to discontinue. Mould has been found in cake's from the bakery. When I've told them they just say sorry and still the bakery brings in mouldy cakes. This is not only a health hazard but a lack of care problem. Many staff don't want to work. I never see a smile like I used too. The checkout staff have become judgmental and somewhat rude. Gone are the days of JD Coles . And his booming business.
