Often the bakery section is low on certain items when the store opens at 7am, suggesting bakery staff commence their daily shifts too late in the morning.\nColes management needs to understand that its shelves should be fully stocked with fresh produce when the doors open at 7am (not at 9am or 10am), each & every day, to provide the best shopping experience for its customers.",

The service desk had issue with changing the price, as per the label, but called over the manager \u2018Grant\u2019 to assist. Grant stated that it was a third party item and he would not honour the price as displayed and I would have to pay full price. In the end I wasted nearly 20 minutes just to be told the price on the shelf was not the price you pay at the register. Grant, your service and lack of empathy is appalling, consider a roll in an area that doesn\u2019t involve customers as you don\u2019t seem to care about them",

            "reviewBody": "I\u2019m writing this review on behalf of a housemate I live with who went to pickup the order that I had placed for the household. He went to pick up a \u201cdelivery to boot\u201d order from Coles Coburg the one along Sydney Rd. \n\nAfter I made a booking to pick up the groceries. I got an email confirming my pickup time and notifying me what items were out of stock and the substitutions that were made.\n\nI can\u2019t remember where it was but there is a button that I clicked on to let them know when I am on the way and that they will prepare the order.\n\nAfter clicking on the button it then says that your order is being prepared and to follow the directions to the waiting bay and then give them a call. But they didn\u2019t specify a number to call them on. Before he left he asked me what number to call? And I said I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll see if I can find out.\n \nMeanwhile I didn\u2019t know what number to call so I tried calling the Store front and it rang out. I was waiting for like 15 mins on the phone and gave up. \n\nWhen he got there the waiting bay was full up and people were waiting in their cars in the car park. \n\nNot knowing the number to call he went inside and spoke to someone standing near the door and she said wait while I make a call to click and collect and then she told him to talk to the worker at the checkout. \n\nHe spoke to the worker at the checkout and she told him to wait for the click and collect person to come out who was somewhere in the store. But the click and collect person didn\u2019t come out. \n\nAnother person showed up who also didn\u2019t know what number to call. My housemate spoke to the checkout person again. The checkout worker replied that she couldn\u2019t help him inside and that he would have to go outside and wait at the waiting bay. \n\nSo he went outside and waited at the waiting bay and the same people who were waiting in the bay when he first got there were still waiting\u2026 so he waited again and  this is what they do they come out, they ask each person if this is their delivery by name. They ask each person Miss Tran???????\nAnd everyone else is like nah. When they finally got to us Our delivery to boot ended up being outside of the waiting bay.\n\nIn total he had been waiting an hour and a half, standing on his feet and not sitting in the car and he is an old person by the way with a botched leg.\n\nHe told me he would never do that again. I replied that I will only get deliveries to the door from now on since my experience with that has improved. \n\nHe told me that he could have gotten the shopping done well before an hour and a half had he gone in store to shop. He told me that the order was not packed and that after  he got the groceries he went inside to buy toilet paper which couldn\u2019t be ordered online because the website said it was out of stock. But there was plenty on the shelves.\n\nWhen I received the order there was no invoice paper and some things were missing that I wasn\u2019t notified of in their previous email. So I had to look on the online invoice to see what had happened with the order. There where more items missing from the order than originally stated which was really annoying. Some of the details are inaccurate like when it comes to whether they substituted or not. Like it\u2019ll have substituted even though it wasn\u2019t or the out of stock when it wasn\u2019t as it was bagged. It was very confusing to read through.\n\nMy housemate told me that their reason for such a long wait was that they were getting all the orders from the Coles over in Coburg North. Since the Coles over there wasn\u2019t accepting online orders.\n\nAlso my housemate said he backed against the wall that had the number to call. So that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t see it.\n\nAll this waiting happened on Thursday the 23rd of September.",

Price check back told me the product price is marching the displayed price. I went back to check myself, only found the price tag had been taken off, and there was no price tag for that product on the shelf. I questioned the staff that someone may take the price tag off the shelf while doing the price checking, and how could he tell me the price for this product is correct if there is no price tag on the shelf? Without explanation, the staff started to change the price in the system. I went to complain to the\u00a0services\u00a0manager about the misconduct about the staff, but he wasn't interested in my complaint, instead, he insulted me by yelling to the staff \u201c give it to him for free, that's just what he wants.\u201d",
