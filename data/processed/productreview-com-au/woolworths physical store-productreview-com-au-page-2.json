If I had the money in my account I might have used it but why should I be forced to just get equal service? Just so that you can track my purchases and sell my data? \n\nI will not be discriminated by Woolworths any longer and after 30 years I will now fully boycott Woolworths and shop elsewhere that actually respects their customers and their cash.\n\nIn my previous shopping experience there, it took almost 10 minutes and 3 different staff members to authorise a free product after I was charged incorrectly. Finally after further argument from the manager, the meat was THROWN onto the counter and I was told \"just take it\".",

            "reviewBody": "So I\u2019ll preface this by saying the 3 stars is based around the awful at times extra points counter for the rewards and some foods being off for months and they don\u2019t remove them. There is plenty of other things though of course. \n\nSo I get these like dumplings, 5 or so ingredients only and natural as I can\u2019t have or it\u2019s better I don\u2019t have any nasty numbers. Histamine and stomach issues abound. Now this isn\u2019t their issue I suppose but you get so hyped up over these new products that only they stock and than the product is bad. Sometimes they are completely inedible and $6 goes in the bin. \n\nTheir bread is awful, they make nothing decent. On the few occasions that we forgot they had bad bread we bought it and it was so bitter we threw the bags straight in the trash and we were reminded why we never bought their bread again. We cannot have sourdough but maybe it\u2019s good as it\u2019s always sold out. \n\nTheir deli is relatively fine most days, although some meats they say they cut this morning but they look days old. In fact a lot of it looks days old. \n\nWe don\u2019t really eat much of anything these days due to our issues, so all our foods are always in stock. \n\nWatch out for their yogurt section and any section nearby, check the dates like your life depends on it, because it does in this section. Some stuff is months old, telling them doesn\u2019t seem to get it removed either. You\u2019d likely get more of a reaction if you ploughed the container into the ground and let the stench hit everyone\u2019s noses lol. \n\nNow the rewards program \u2026 most of the several points boosters, where it shows you like 10 items you can get boosts on is a disaster. We haven\u2019t used those items in years at times and it still says I get a boost on it if I buy it. Like coconut water, had a mad histamine reaction to this last year, why did it pop up in my points booster today? \n\nHonestly the entire points booster today cannot be used as we don\u2019t eat or drink any of those things anymore haven\u2019t for months or years. This also isn\u2019t the first time, this happens and has happened for years, it\u2019s just that now it\u2019s at it\u2019s worst. Now there\u2019s not a single item I can get boosted whereas before there was always at least 1. \n\nAh home brand pastas too, chemical smells, wouldn\u2019t even prepare them even if you paid me to do it. Home brand gluten free crackers have quiet the chemical smells at times too from the packaging and it seeps into the food. \n\nThe points booster aggravates me to no end and it made me so mad this morning that this review was born from that rage haha. It was also about time I reviewed them anyways. For now this is all I remember, if I remember anything else I\u2019ll add it on later.",

However, it went downhill from there.\n\nThe cashier did not acknowledge my existence, looked at her watch a few times during check out and when I asked for my receipt, she pointed to it and said \"it is right there\".  Clearly, she should not be interacting with customers.  \n\nNo thank you.  No verbal acknowledgent of contact.  There is no excuse for not saying thank you to your customers.  \n\nWhile I was grateful to have someone to provide what is siupposed to be full service, perhaps this is Woolworths way of saying I should check my own groceries.  At any rate, this employee should be reallocated within the store where she does not have to interact with any customers.  I'm sure there is a more suitable job for her.",

The reality is that 'For your convenience' means 'For Woolworths convenience.' I prefer to use cash, so the setup definitely isn't convenient for me. Other supermarkets (yes, Coles, I'm talking about you) manage to have multiple machines that take cash or card, so why is it so difficult for Woolworths to do it?

I live 100 KLM round trip. Extra $20 petrol to take the apples back. No way.\nI often ignore it because of all  the cost and effort. But now I'm on product review I might as well complain about the many times the dockets are hard to read, which once cost me a couple of hundred dollars, when I went to claim on mouse rebate from the Government. ( Still got mouse rebate receipts.)  Government paid all of my Coles receipts for mouse bait purchases ($350 from memory) but Woolworths couple receipts they would not pay out in due to being unreadable.  Even though I could still faintly see date/purchase/price, if mouse bait purchases.  Can't blame Government for not paying out, as receipts all got scanned /photocopied before sending off to claim.  So I lost out money wise.  This really goes back years for faint print on dockets at Woolworths.   Never had it, or noticed it at Coles ever. All their dockets clear print that I can remember.  Now it's another problem  -  Hands, apples, bench, mobile phone all sticky apple juice. More cleaning up I guess.\nWoolworths you MUST of known these apples weren't fit for eating.  Why package them up for sale then, I ask myself  ....",

The trolleys were newly introduced to this particular store and were already grotty and mould was showing the first stages of growth. With lots of areas for grime to gather on every part of the trolley, in this case it already was, these will soon be an festering breeding ground that can make people sick. All of the east coast of Australia from Sydney upwards, suffers from humidity and mould and I can see a disaster of suable sicknesses being contracted from the trolleys themselves. Stainless steel does not breed mould and does not harbour germs. How are these plastic trolleys going to be kept hygienic and clean? With Covid still a threat, with humidity and mould, these trolleys are a breeding ground for anything that can fester. I don't know what I am going to do if all woolworths supermarkets start using these trolleys. I will have to stop using the supermarket altogether. They are poorly designed for hygiene purposes. People who live down south in Australia don't understand the mold issues suffered in humid areas. If you put your handbag onto a mouldy surface, mould spores open up and spread, you then take your bag into your car and home, this puts fresh mould spores into these new spaces. These trolleys may have been a good idea for the enviroment, but they are not a good idea for peoples health and hygiene.",
