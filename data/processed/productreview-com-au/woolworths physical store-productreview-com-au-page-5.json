            "reviewBody": "I was shopping at Woolworths Docklands store and decided to pick up some Fever Tree tonic water.\n1. Because they haven't had the cheaper Schwepps version for over a month and\n2. Because it was on special at $6.50 marked down from $7.50.\nI went through the self service checkout and the items scanned at the full (non discounted) price.\nI called the store attendant over, the one who is there to make sure people don't steal from them. I told her about the pricing error and she wouldn't take me word for it and asked someone to verify that I was telling the truth. After a period of waiting I asked her if I should go and take a photo of the item to prove that I wasn't trying to rip off Woolworths to the tune of $2.00 as I had purchased two packs.\nI returned with the photographic evidence which still wasn't acceptable until a store employee had independently verified that I was in fact correct.\nThe most disturbing thing is that once it was verified she changed my order to reflect the true price but did not note it down to change it in the system. It will just continue to over charge customers who buy that product.\nWhen did customer service at Woolworths become so diabolically poor? The prevailing attitude is that all customers are dishonest.\nAwful company providing an awful experience.\nCheck your bill people before Woolworths steal from your hip pocket.\nYou have lost your way!",

We pay the extra price to choose woolies for not only quality products but also good service. That is a thing of the past. I will think twice before I shop there again.

Trolleys with empty cardboard we\u2019re also in aisles along with expired groceries. The store looks and has feels unorganised and dirty. There have been occasions the off smell from the deli section is disgusting, other times the smell of bleach again from the deli department is unbearable. It appears the store manager has either no interest or is incompetent. We will be looking to go Cole\u2019s as the store is clean, fruit is fresher and shelves are properly stacked, 100% better than the Woolworths store.",

The edges are dried out, even before removing from the plastic film, and as it thaws, it cracks. How disappointing. Yes, it is cheaper, but Woolworths supposedly pride themselves on offering comparable quality to the named brands - in this case, you definitely get what you pay for!",
