Our family purchase items from it almost daily.\nHowever, since it has changed to become a Metro store, we have missed many items that we have bought regularly in the past.\nFor example: Laucke bread mix, large Vanilla Extract bottle, small tissue boxes for the car, Oat Flakes, a range of gluten free breakfast options, Lens conditioning solution, Cheese twists, large dog food biscuit bags, and other items that don't come to mind at the moment.\nI guess the store has been categorised as a Metro and different amounts of things are now sent to our store. \nThis is despite there being lots of vacant spaces on many shelves to still sell these products.\nfor your information .  Please consider that we and others miss many products that you used to sell here.\nthanks.\nkind regards\nAlison W",

Only to find it was directly next to the bacon that was falling into the section with plant based items. It's hard as it is to eat vegan food in a market where meat is so heavily marketed. The last thing I want to see when looking for food is packages of cut up pig in the vegan section. I found this to be extremely insensitive to people who choose to not eat meat. I thought Woolworths had Greta vegan variety but I will now choose to shop elsewhere as I found this to be very inappropriate, especially given there is bacon in a variety of areas around the store.",

At least we have an IGA store as an alternative. Some of their products are a bit more expensive, but at least they are generally well stocked, have friendly competent staff and a buy local policy which means fresh local produce is sold there.\nP.S: attached photo is proof I'm done with Woolworths!",

Was told that they do not do refunds and that I could exchange it, having already spent over 100.00 on my shopping I then asked could I have a credit, no, they only do exchange, asked to speak to the store manager, after waiting over 5 minutes the came back with tired old excuse, he is in a meeting would I like to come back later. Took my product and said no I would not come back later in fact after shopping at WW for over 20 years will never come back. Shame on you Woolies.",

I opened them to use when I got home (within a couple of hours of purchase) and the first orange I took out had a large bad spot.  I submitted a complaint to Woolworths the next morning but have had no response at all.  I expected that the oranges would be covered by their fresh food guarantee, but they haven't even bothered to reply with an apology.\nOn looking at the fine print of their 'Fresh or Free' guarantee I find that it does not cover packaged produce unless it is marked with their fresh or free symbol.  I guess a net of oranges is packaged (and I don't remember seeing any fresh or free symbol on it) so is not covered by their fresh food promise.  So buyer beware (and check your packaged produce purchases carefully before paying for them!)",

A new store manager has recently been appointed to the store to improve the toxic culture. The group manager committed to improving the store for locals in the rural area where there is no alternative large supermarket. I recently visited the store to see if improvements had been made. \nI found no change. Staff were reluctant to assist, grim and unfriendly. When I visited the fish counter and asked when the 'fresh' fish arrived, the staff did not know. I asked to speak to the store manager and was told there was no store manager on that day. I was then bossed around by a loud, highly-strung, defensive supervisor who was reluctant to answer the question and visibly irritated that I had asked it. She then went on confirm that the fish was six days old and that this was considered fresh. She then tried to excuse this by saying that it was on 'special' for this reason. I asked if there were any full-priced fresher fish available and was told that they had to use up the old fish first. I declined the purchase and narrowly avoided being run down by a store picker on my way out of the store.\nI no longer shop there and never will again.
