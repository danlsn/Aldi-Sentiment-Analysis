They asked to provide the receipt from the person who gifted, if I wanted to get the money loaded! Off course, it is a gift card and I wont be asking for the receipt and they know it very well.\n\nAs a courtesy they offered me $50 and loosing me $100. So if they cheat 100 customers like this a month, that is like $10,000 (100ppl x $100 = $10,000), which is $1,20,000/year earnings by cheating customers as they are sure most of them wont go back to person who gifted the card.\n\nStay away from woolworths gift cards!!!",

            "reviewBody": "It appears Woolworths are the most diligent when capitalizing on the Coronavirus outbreak. Albeit they boast lower prices, compared to their competitors, they are nothing but a rip-off outfit. Their fresh fruit and vegetables are generally poor quality while overpriced. Overall, the best by far is Aldi, whose prices have remained pretty constant throughout the pandemic. Woolworths, not only satisfied with exploiting hard-pressed consumers, have become extremely militant when it comes to returns. \n\nA few months ago, I returned 4 Hass avocados to Woolworths Whitfords City WA as they were clearly diseased. The person who assisted me was polite but when it came to the refund and exchange, she curtly advised either or - not both. I asked to speak to the manager to which she replied she IS the manager. She added that she had NEVER heard of that policy. I accepted an exchange as by this time there was a queue. See the excerpt from the Woolworths returns policy:  \n\nWoolworths Fresh or Free Guarantee\n\"The Woolworths Returns Policy applies in conjunction with our Fresh or Free Guarantee. Under our Fresh or Free Guarantee, we\u2019ll refund AND replace any fresh food you're not happy with which is sold online or in-store.\" See website: https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/discover/about-us/returns-policy\n\nOn the 26/02/22 I returned a 175g packet of SMITHS Thinly Cut Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips. This product was outright disgusting  - way too much salt & vinegar and overcooked. Initially, I was refused a refund but after the assistant consulted with his manager, was given the refund as a \"once off favour\" as \"Woolworths are changing their refunds policy\" in their words. And no \"change of mind\" would be entertained in future. Well, Mr. RIP-OFF Woolworths, this was NOT a change-of-mind return. And the ACCC clearly states that all returns are conducted from the point of sale. Furthermore, it appears that Woolworths Group Pty Ltd have forgotten the ACCC / Big W fiasco whereby Big W were fobbing off consumers who had issues with their Dyson appliances. Big W were not accepting returns, telling customers to deal direct with Dyson. The ACCC /Big W outcome is well documented and can be viewed on the ACCC website titled \"Big W will address customer complaints about faulty Dyson appliances.\" dated 15th October 2019. The contemptuous and arrogant Woolworths Group Ltd clearly need to be reminded that the ACCC will take action against any BODY acting ultra vires - nor are they exempt from accountability. Given my adverse experiences, Woolworths are nothing but militant money grabbers with little regard for consumer rights.",

            "reviewBody": "I really cant understand how a supermarket chain of this size cannot get the basics right yet continue to make astronomical profits.\nThe signage is totaly messed up making it extra hard to find things, the main signs tucked in the aisle so you have to walk up and down the whole store to read them.\nTripping up over giant trolleys of stock left blocking aisle in the middle of the day.\nConstantly running out of budget brands so you have to buy the so called \"premium\" brand at 3X price.\nBad positioning of foods that should go in the same space, but instead are at either ends of the shop.\nDirty rickety trolleys and baskets with vegetable leftovers stuck inside them make great places to put food in guys, thanks.\nA 2 per person limit on tiny box of painkillers despite THOUSANDS of boxes on the shelf, genius move there.\nAnd if you do eventually make it to the self serve checkout only half of them take cash, its nice squishing around people as they stand confused as to which machine they can use.\nThen the bags, you're expected to BUY a bag for $1 made outa some tent material cause they ran out of regular bags? My local shop even had a GIANT steel box like bunnings filled with crap cardboard boxes blocking half the checkout area. WHY DONT YOU HAVE BAGS??? REALLY?!?! horrible in store experience.\nBut dont try to avoid it, buying online is MUCH MUCH worse, more than 24hrs to deliver 2 blocks away and it turned up in a taxi at 6pm after a whole bunch of confusion. This place is ridiculous and sad in so many ways, I dont have enough words to describe it. Go to the REAL local even if it costs more, its worth it, this place is about maximizing cash flow not serving customers. bye",

The check out supervisor at Woolworths Middle Camberwell was telling me of policies that did not exist. It\u2019s like even if it is faulty product if they cannot find your receipt or if you loose your receipt you don\u2019t get a refund. \nVery rude staff and misinformation given out. I am highly disappointed and angry with this treatment",
