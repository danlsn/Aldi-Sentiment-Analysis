I went into a store and attempted to access on December 2 and could not. I also could not access anyone to help me with the problem.  I had already had issues with accessing a trolley in the store it has made for memorable shopping experience in that store. By memorable I mean I will avoid the store unless absolutely necessary."",""reviewRating"":{""@type"":""Rating"",""bestRating"":""5"",""worstRating"":""1"",""ratingValue"":""1""},""publisher"":{""@id"":""https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1""},""inLanguage"":""en""},{""@type"":""Review"",""@id"":""https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/woolworths.com.au/63b3b3cf2338b6d417ae0a63"",""itemReviewed"":{""@id"":""https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/woolworths.com.au""},""author"":{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""TP"",""url"":""https://au.trustpilot.com/users/63b3b3471caa130012d667fb/""},""datePublished"":""2023-01-03T06:49:19.000Z"",""headline"":""This is my favorite online supermarket…"",""reviewBody"":""This is my favorite online supermarket website."",""reviewRating"":{""@type"":""Rating"",""bestRating"":""5"",""worstRating"":""1"",""ratingValue"":""5""},""publisher"":{""@id"":""https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1""},""inLanguage"":""en""},{""@type"":""Review"",""@id"":""https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/woolworths.com.au/63884673b84cc27618fc9e19"",""itemReviewed"":{""@id"":""https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/woolworths.com.au""},""author"":{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Nathan Hand"",""url"":""https://au.trustpilot.com/users/6388433d9fdc2c0012feb987/""},""datePublished"":""2022-12-01T08:15:15.000Z"",""headline"":""woolies delivery service has been amazing"",""reviewBody"":""I've found the service to be really good.
