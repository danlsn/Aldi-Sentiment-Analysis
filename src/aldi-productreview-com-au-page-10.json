One after the  other of the bulbs failed, the dimmable were a particular joke - flickering like a strobe,  darkening, brightening and then reducing permanently stuck barely like a night light. Even though packaging clearly stated Aldi, refused to honour guarantee. Next: the porcini mushroom triangles. 3 packs fed four and leftovers.  Suddenly we were fighting over five triangles each. I looked at the packs and they had been drastically shrunken. But same price!!!! Ricotta in a basket, the same!!!! Laundry liquid - first the lid / measuring cup capacity doubled, meaning we were suddenly tricked into using more. Next purchase, the thick concentrated liquid had turned as thin as water!!! Now I tear through a bottle in weeks instead of months. The Lyttos yoghurt - God knows what they did there, but package change coincided with a decline in taste and consistency. Who knows how many more items have been doctored and fudged and tweaked to stooge their customers. So so deceitful, Aldi - you STINK. And it's not cheap anymore - people compare with your local greengrocer and stop supporting these thieves. Absolute disgrace, Aldi!!!!!",

The cream was everywhere including my purse, my phone and my sunglasses. The bag is now in the bin and the rest cleaned. The lady on the checkout never once apologised, not interested. I was even obliged to ask for a cloth as she offered nothing to clean the mess everywhere. She only acknowledged the incident long enough to ask if I knew where the lid was. Yes, still in my bag floating around in the cream. I handed it across - still no apology!  Yes, probably  the most dismissive and rude member of staff I have ever encountered. My new bag is now in the bin and this has turned out to be a really expensive bottle of cream.  PS. Why can I never find wipes to clean trolleys??",

I returned the pack to Aldi this afternoon and even the cashier at the counter called for someone to remove the package due to the foul smell.\n\nTo add insult to injury Aldi reimbursed me for the item but didn't offer a free replacement .

I opened the cardboard box and inside were some decent sized prawns in prosciutto as promised. They were just rolling around in the cardboard box. It wasn\u2019t a wax box or protected and the prawns weren\u2019t in plastic . Very lazy packing . The smell when I opened the box wasn\u2019t very pleasant or fresh smelling at all.\n\nI started to cook these as instructed and noticed the white freezer burn on the tails. Again the smell while cooking was not appealing at all . \n\nFinally cooked and not really as excited anymore I finally tried one. It was absolutely disgusting and definately not right. It tasted off . I threw the rest out . Yuck!!!\n\nI absolutely love Aldi and actually went there to look for lobster tails but it\u2019s a big hell no after those putrid prawns . Who does your quality control, why would a company throw seafood in a cardboard box that\u2019s not sealing in plastic first. Has anyone at Aldi ever opened one of these? Can\u2019t say as a chef that I\u2019ve ever seen anything like that before . \n\nYour prawns are disgusting and not fresh when frozen or they thawed out at some stage and were refrozen very dangerous combination regardless . \n\nWhat a waste of $19 .",

I again visited the Morley branch and Inglewood branch only to be told that as a result of Covid 19 deliveries to stores could not be guaranteed. When other super markets sell out of product or it is unavailable one is able to obtain a rein check and be advised when the product becomes available. Not Aldi. It has happened before when a product is advertised and only small quantities are available thus tricking the customer to visit the store in the hope they buy other goods. Customers not interested in excuses about pandemics or anything else. If the product is not sitting in the local warehouse it should not be advertised for sale. Management have attitude and are untrained in customer service.",

Local Store Manager said the catalogue item did not come in: \u201cit may arrive in a week, or it could be a month, so check available stock details online.\u201d  The Manager\u2019s parting comment was: \u201cIf we didn\u2019t receive stock, neither will any nearby stores.\u201d\nLooked at ALDI\u2019s website, as suggested \u2014 \u201cSpecial Buys Product Delays\u201d and \u201cCheck Available Stock\u201d.  Of the twenty nearby stores: ten indicated - We are sold out; nine indicated - ! No stock information available; and one indicated - Stock available. \nRang ALDI\u2019s only listed contact number (13 25 34) to confirm the stock situation. The phone prompts indicated it was not possible to speak to a real person, let alone a specific ALDI store. So, I travelled over thirty kilometres to the store listed as having stock, only to find it had just two 4K TVs, both of which were faulty returns and as such were not available for sale.\nCome on ALDI, at least try to be fair dinkum. We understand hustling customers through checkouts and providing no store contact details is part of the model that keeps costs down.  Nonetheless, ALDI could at least make an effort to ensure that the one and only point of contact system ALDI wants customers to use is at least capable of differentiating between Stock available (total stock inventory) and Stock Fit/Ready for Sale.",
