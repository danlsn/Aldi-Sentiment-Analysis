When unpacking at home we found that the golden kiwi-fruit in the pre-packed punnet were all rotten. What a disappointment as it required me to drive back to the Mall and return the bad item to Aldi. To rub salt into the wound I had to go to the back of a long queue and wait my turn to get a credit. This was not the first time that we saw fruit rotting in the shelves at this branch. Isn\u2019t it the supplier who is supposed to check the condition of the merchandise to make sure it is good and healthy?",

When i checked the ingredients at my local ALDI i noticed that they did not have the \"meat & meat by products\" (whatever that means) & decided to try the Natural Elements Grain Free Chicken.
