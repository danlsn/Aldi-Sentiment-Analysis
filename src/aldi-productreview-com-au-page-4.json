She said that's how Aldi works.   While I tried to put couple of things in the bag she said you need to pay now.  She wanted me to stop straight away and pay so that she could scan next customer.  It made me feel extremely rushed and bad.  Later on i went to woolies and bought products that were actually similar budget to Aldi.  I realised why should i go to Aldi when the staff treats poorly and ruins  entire day.",

Trolley tag in hand, was looking for a trolley. I asked the cashier where were the trolleys, and he said downstairs. So back downstair I go to grab my trolley, then back in the lift to the ground floor, to finally commence my shop.\n2. As soon as I pushed my trolley through the entry gates, I heard the announcement, \"this store will be closing shortly, please proceed to the registers\". I thought I had 19 minutes to go, but I was going to be quick. Before I even made it to the end of the first aisle, the announcement was repeated. There are only 5 aisles at the store. I heard the announcement every 30-45 seconds! This is disrespectful to shoppers. I spent a total of $42.91 and checked out at 19:51, frazzled. I asked the cashier who controls the announcements, he said he is instructed to push the button every so often. Seriously? As a former checkout chick and front end controller, we used to advise customers 5 minutes before store close with one announcement, followed by another announcement 1 minute before the store closes. \nAldi please review your procedures, and also ensure trolleys are available at all times.",

Apparently they are too busy dealing with a myriad of calls. Or so the dulcet tones of the recorded young person tells me. This means they obviously can't spare the time to deal with me. So, off to Aldi online I go to find a number so I can speak to a real person. But, they have obviously outsourced all their real talking people for some super dooper, online, money saving, customer duping response. This apparently will be the game changer and solve every problem I have with Aldi and Bauhn. Except, that has no ability to inform them of their useless, stupid, non working, waste of time and money, dopey, earbud rubbish. Well done Aldi, seeya.",

            "reviewBody": "Aldi Tarneit Gardens. \nI had a very nasty experience today. The assistant store manager at Aldi Tarneit Central absolutely berated and embarrassed me in front of the whole shop. I was paying half cash and half card. I paid $6 cash and there was $8.97 left on the till to go on card. Unbeknownst to me there was only $8.95 on the card. No problem. With technology nowadays it\u2019s a 30 second transfer. But alas the reception at this Aldi is horrible so of course it took a bit longer. But honestly while he was walking around, banging the cash register, berating me and shouting at me and teaching me a life lesson on how I should have organised my life better and been a better customer and showing with his actions how frustrated he was that I wasting his time the money had transferred and I was ready to pay. But he still wasn\u2019t happy. I offered to go back in line inside he refused. I offered to go to another till. He refused. I walked away and just cried and cried in my car. I had one baby in my arms and 3 year old with me.\nI don\u2019t know. Is this a classic example of when you put a man of colour in a position of power they think they can talk to you and shout at you with impunity?\nDoes he have impunity because he is the assistant store manager? Isn\u2019t leadership about leading by example?\nWhat gives him the right to treat me like this?\nCould it be because I am a black African?\nCould it be because I am a woman? Or god forbid I am both a black African and I am a woman. I spoke to another staff member about this man because this is not the first time he has had a go at me. This staff member said maybe it because he has two children. I have four children and I don\u2019t treat people like he does.\nThis is not acceptable.\nDear Aldi Management Do I need to prove my worthiness and self worth every time I meet the intimidation and bullying tactics employed by this man. Is this the culture you guys are promoting in your stores.\nIf he can treat me like this a random stranger at the check out how is he going to treat his colleagues especially when he is promoted from assistant to full manager.\nThere is no place in this world for his gross inappropriate behaviour and his reckless and blatant rudeness in a shop full of paying customers. Common ALDI. You can do better.\nI felt worthless and felt like I was the dirt that he thought I was.\nPlease speak to him. Give him counselling. Training in leadership and communication. Anger management. Anything.",

The sheets are less than 18months old and have been used for a week at a time, for probably 6 or 7 times max.  The sheets constantly make fine fluff/dust, and the fitted sheet has become so thin where we lay that there's now a hole!  You can feel, and see (ref pictures attached)  a significant difference between the thickness of the flat part and around the edges - its just disappointing and terrible.",

            "reviewBody": "One instance at the Bonnyrigg store, a team member walked between myself and the product shelving whilst I was attempting to select a product. No \"excuse me\" or apology for cutting me off, he just walked on past oblivious to what he'd done. \nAnother instance at the same store. This particular day I had to use the hand baskets, as I had misplaced my trolley token. Struggling with 2x heavy baskets at the checkout. It wasn't until I had repacked the baskets and was about to leave the store that a team member screamed at me at the top of her voice \"you can't take the basket outside...\". I had every intention of returning them after I packed my car. There was no offer of assistance (e.g. empty cartons, apology, etc.) just a disrespectful rant from the checkout. Aldi either needs to revisit their customer service training, or employ team members that have previous customer service (retail) experience. A team member screaming at an unsuspecting customer at the top of their voice, in front of a shop full of other customers, is not what call \"good customer service\".\nI'm going to Woolies today. It'll probably cost me more, be it only for the higher level of checkout service, it will be worth it.",

I felt sorry for the checkout operator as she was obviously instructed by management that holding up a long row of customers was quite OK as we had all the patience in the world apparently. \n\nHe then took a leisurely stroll to his car, presumably to find a card that did work, or perhaps had money in it. We all patiently waited for him to return as we had no choice really. Nope, second card didn't work either. I had had enough at this stage and said it was unfair to keep a long line of customers waiting while this was going on. No response at all from the checkout operator. \n\nC'mon Aldi. You really think it's fair to hold up a long line of customers in situations like this? He couldn't put his goods in a trolley until all was sorted? A half hour wait for the rest of us and absolutely nothing was resolved during this time.",

When Southport Park opened, I asked to chasier if I needed to know anything I should know as it was my first ALDI visit. \u201cNo\u201d Back then bags were not a thing you had to buy @ Coles etc.  So I get to the end, they do not supply bags! Causing her to \u201cSigh Heavily\u201d and me being embarrassed for holding things up. I was mortified. I didn\u2019t go back for a very long time. Until I was asked to purchase an ALDI product for someone. \nOne checkout, no people waiting. The cashier was sleeping around the checkouts area. ( I had to vacuum my shop, I IMMEDIATLEY shut it down to serve), she carried on until she finished. I said \u201c You guys need  to leave the Register unlike Coles etc\u201d , she responded \u201c well! how do you expect to get cheaper prices if I don\u2019t! Someone has to pay somewhere!\u201d\nThats was it for me for years after that! Until, ALDI was directly accross the road from my sons tutor in Oxenford. I needed Milk! \nEarly evening! One guy floating in and out the Register area, one young gentlemen at the Register. I was last in line  of three cutomers, sadly I only had milk and 3 other items, the two ahead of me had moderator shops. \nI got to my turn, He got up, left his station, grabbed a sleeping moj learning against the wall, ran it up and down 5 times in the area behind him\u2026still no word\u2026and sat back down  like this was a procedure I should be familiar with. To his credit, he was very scriptedly courteous after that. What was that?\nHas this kind of thing happened to anyone else?\nI just don\u2019t get this place?",
