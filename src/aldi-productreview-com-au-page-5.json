I know it is 'Buyer Beware' but it is still very confusing for customers.  I think we should have a big campaign about prepackaged items.\n\nAs well as the different price per kg for the same product, it is very wasteful to have vegetables labelled and packed on trays with plastic covers.",

Do not expect to be able to collect such an item from the receiving dock.  Just struggle yourself, as Aldi are more concerned about your cash than customers.  If this bulky item is faulty gain expect no assistance.  I fully except buying items is the customers responsibility - however if the item is faulty, I believe the retailer is required to assist in the return of said item.  It is called \" Duty of Care\" \nAldi do not have a customer service contact phone number  - just a web form - which times out after 5 minutes; hence its impossible to provide or share your negative experiences.  \nIf you purchase a new product and you require a spare part do to an initial failure, you deal with their agent, Action Spares - and equally pathetic non customer focused entity,  you must sign a waiver to say you will accept a refurbished - second hand part - Really!!  is this acceptable for a new product particularly during these pandemic times - you will also receive an email saying the part may take up to 28 days to be received.  \nTrue, I could have asked for a refund however I would then have to borrow a suitable vehicle and incur additional costs to return the item.\n\nIn short, pathetic retailer with a care factor of zero!!\n\nItem in question Air Resistance Rower - first one faulty after minimal use, second one fault parts- could not be assembled from new,,",

It is very hard to download the app without sufficient data so I rang to recharge. I managed to do so however Aldi did not understand my request and failed to complete as I had requested. After I had the new app I discovered another problem apart from no data rollover. I rang back but achieved little. Now I find their signal strength has recently been reduced.

But these were disgusting followed all the cooking instructions,  they literally tasted like all the bits that get cut of , were scooped up put through a mincer and shaped like a fillet then crumbed and frozen,  I'm not even sure it was even fish and no the of cuts from other sea creatures.  Not sure what to do with the rest as we only just opened the bag, hate to throw food away,  but if you feel sick after eating it probably not worth eating again.  Also the packet says product of China made and packaged in China from Chinese products.  Oh well another reason not to shop at Aldi,  over 30 years of shopping in Aldi both in Australia and Germany,  you're loosing me between empty shelves not horrible tasting food.

I have been buying this product for 5 years, it never gave off this smell, only recently. It tastes the same but the smell is so strong that my eyes became all teary as I smelled it. Either there's too much acidity regulators or there's something else that's been recently added in the ingredients which doesn't sit right.",

Today, 27th, I checked on IGA's price for rhe same teabags. Would you believe they were advertised at $8.08,  or $3.09 MORE than ALDI. Whilst this is the biggest price gouge I've seen on a single article, it's typical of the IGA prices, which is why we drive to Bendigo, besides which the fuel is generally 15c per litre cheaper",

When I got home to remove the bag my front car seat was saturated with Di San stain remover. I looked in the bag and the top was completely off. I took the groceries back to exchange them because they were soaking wet. The young girl got the manager and from the beginning he pretty said I must have dropped the bag. Now if I had dropped the bag would I have put it on my front .seat? After many heated words, I got them exchanged. He really embarrassed and enraged me by insisting I did it. I offer to take him to my car to show the large stain on my front seat. He refused. Insidently this happened before with vinegar and I didn't go back because it was a bottle by itself. Sorry to go on but I was really embarrassed at the situation. The photos show the stained seat, the saturated bag and the groceries I got replaced after heated argument.  I wish I thought to take one of saturated items.",

Best eggs I\u2019ve had in a long time. So cheap for free range and actually hold their shape when u crack them open. Tried about 7 different meat products. All fine. Don\u2019t let Woolies or Coles be allowed to get away with inflated prices\u2026shop with yr feet and try Aldi. Maybe Coles won\u2019t be so greedy if they lose enough customers like me. Only fault I will say is sometimes shelves are a bit empty, bakery shelves in particular and I have to go in Coles & get bread.",
