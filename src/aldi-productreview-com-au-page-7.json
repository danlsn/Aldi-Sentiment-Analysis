I cannot believe how miserable  the cashier was and how he had zero customer service  .. Never have i paid for my groceries and had the cashier be totally silent .No acknowledgment at all until he asked for payment . You can have the cheapest prices and all the stock you want but if your staff can\u2019t even crack a smile or  acknowledge customers Aldi is well below standard of any supermarket i have ever visited .  Why was /is team member employed ??",

The clerk then said my wife is banned from coming in the store again. 1) The store has to equip itself to ensure that a customer pay for everything they have, don't let your honest customer feel like a criminal for your lack of security systems. 2) it is not good practice for a mail clerk to request to search a female's bag 3) the behaviour of your clerk is unacceptable, he should be reprimanded and trained how to treat customers with respect. Not good for your stores image, on the second day after opening",

However, in the toilet paper department I find this Aldi store is missing toilet paper frequently. Of course I could just take the advice of a fellow shopper when I complained at the cash register, she advised me to go to Woolworths! And I did. I bought their cheap TP, and it looks like I shall have to continue doing so as again today no toilet paper. Aldis is apparently Oz made, so its a mystery as to why it is missing. Also why is it a new product is on the shelves once then never seen again? I cant wait the win the lottery so I can afford NOT to shop at Aldi.",

            "reviewBody": "Have previously used expensive professional/commercial grout cleaners in that are hard to find and reek of nasty chemicals. Saw this at Aldi this morning and I thought for $4.49 I\u2019d give it a crack.\nWow. This product knocked the ball out of the park. INSTANT results. I didn\u2019t let it sit for five minutes, just sprayed it on and got my faithful Tek hard bristled toothbrush out and the dirt brushed off with one stroke.\nOf all the cleaning jobs that need doing around the house, this is by far the most satisfying as you get instant results and it completely changes the look of a room. I cannot speak more highly of this product. So easy to use and so fast. No scrubbing, just a matter of using a bristle brush to dislodge the dirt that the spray has loosened. Great stuff!\nIf you\u2019re selling your home, make sure you do this first. If you\u2019re renting and have a dreaded inspection coming up, this is a must. Clean grout has an amazing positive effect on the general appearance and cleanliness of a house. You don\u2019t realise how disgusting your grout is until you see the clean version beside it.\nDon\u2019t hesitate to wonder about this Aldi gem - grab it while it\u2019s in stock because the secret is out and they fly off the shelves. This is not an everyday item and was available late March. I got the last bottle available in my local store on 2 April.",

I only picked up the mistake after when I paid when I checked the docket . I ask the check out operator who was actually staff manager named [Name Removed] if they have service desk so mistake can be rectified. He told me in a loud and angry voice that they don\u2019t, but I have to go to back  at the end of line and wait in que all over again when he serves all other customers before me. I naturally reacted that it hardly seems fair as it was not mine mistake or change of my mind but either systems or operator if he didn\u2019t select correct item, he yelled even louder that it is stores policy that I go to the back of the line, I told him that I have never ever anywhere else been treated like that before and that I will not give him good review. He didn\u2019t seem to care whatsoever. Anyway I found another check out with less people in a que and was served with respect and money refunded, yet no apology of any kind. I am in my seventies and great grandmother and being treated like that by young staff manager is extremely disrespectful, and disappointing. I am still so puzzled of rudeness of that person, it\u2019s beyond my understanding and how he could possible have position of staff manager ???",

            "reviewBody": "I had a very unpleasant experience at ALDI, Southland. I have purchased various groceries including 700g Cage Eggs (2 boxes). At the register (#3) I asked the price of these eggs (on printed receipt), the response was $3.59 ea. I said that the price is $3.49. I have been told just to pay for groceries and if it wrong, they will refund it.\nYes, I was right about the price. I went back and show him the photo with advertised price. He took my receipt without saying anything and disappeared for over 5 minutes. After return he mumbled something (I did not hear and understood anything), took my 2 boxes of eggs and refunded the whole amount. I said that the price is wrong and according to ALDI\u2019s policy, the product in this case should be free. I said that I want the eggs back. Then he said that the manager allows to refund 0.59 c for each box and I repeated about the free product. He was rude and wanted to rid of me asap.\nIt hard to believe that the Manager of the store does not know or follow ALDI\u2019s policy (If a regular product scans at a price higher than that displayed, you are entitled to receive the first item free. All subsequent items will be charged at the lower price).\nIt\u2019s a shame that the customer service at many ALDI stores is getting worth. It was one of my favourite supermarkets. I spoke to few of my friends and they noticed the same issues.\nHope my feedback will change it to a better service.",
