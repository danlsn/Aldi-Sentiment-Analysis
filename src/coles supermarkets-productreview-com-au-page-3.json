In doing so he perhaps accidentally, but I suspect otherwise, brushed his palm against my private parts and gave them a gentle squeeze. Now, while I am elderly, and perhaps should have been grateful of the resulting attention, I must say that in 57 years of running my own business dealing with the public, I have never experienced such a jarring incident. My wife Maurene (God rest her soul) would have been inconsolable. The man said something about \"that's not yellow\" and slowly moved away from me, but I am still shaken.\nI feel this would not have happened had the bananas been in their original place at the other end of the produce section.",

We thought about leaving with no groceries, but that would mean doing the whole shopping process again the next day, which I couldn't manage.  So, we had no choice but to manage the scanning and packing ourselves. It was a long, exhausting experience and I was in pain for days afterwards.

When 15 billion is not enough and they turn on the weak and frail, its time to cast them out.\nRefuse them as you would anyone or any business that burdens and withdraws fundamental supports for the frail and vunerable in our society.\nCast them out for the pretense of freezing prices ( just like woolworths ) after the initial 3 months of exponential rampant price increases and product shrinkage.\nThen pretend to freeze prices after the inflation.\n\nThis is Coles world. Wait until they reduce your range choice. Wait until they tell you to use your phone to scan your items as you shop, with your smartphone.\nWait until you have to pack yourself.\nColes is already turning on society.\nToday its the aged ,frail and disabled.\nTomorrow it will be much worse and yes, when you self serve, your aiding there agenda and hurting those you should have empathy for.",

It is more than twice the price at $25.00 for 500g and is filled with a bunch of additives, I have tried the Per Form product and it doesn't agree with my body, I am very disappointed to say the least, COLES you were on a winner before but not NOW. I will have to find a natural product else where. Can you please let me now when you will stock this again. I noticed the picture attached  has a locked price on it till Jan 2023, so technically it should still be available. This product was great for people with allergies as there was only one ingredient (pea protein).\nRegards",

At that moment I was feeling uncomfortable, as I can feel she is being racist. Her attitude was not good at all.\n\nAfter she thoughtfully see my license front and back, I planned to get my license back. She was saying nothing but 'Nah Nah' . I thought she maybe wanna read more thoughtfully. So I gave that back again.\n\nAfter everything done, she directly wrote my name, DOB, license number on a piece of paper from printer. I was shocked as she is not asking my consent nor giving a notice about what she was doing and why. She directly wrote it down on a random paper with my personal information.\n\nI told her she is illegally collecting my personal information, she has to stop or I will call the police. Obviously, police does not care about this.\n\nShe might be realising she was doing something wrong, she said I will ask my store manager to handle this.But you know what, the store manager told her to let me call the police. The store manage did not show up and fix the problem. \n\nI had already officially complained to the customer care. They sent back two emails ,which can be so-called as 'following-up'. From the line I can not feel any apology.\n\nAs this week Optus was  disclosing customer informations, IS THAT LEGAL TO COLLECT customer personal info without consent? Can anyone help me with this?",

I asked to speak to the manager, [Name Removed] the manager at the Chisholm Coles came over, no won't refund this, wasn't bought from this store, his attitude was very blunt and rude.

It can't be resold it's not working! Do the right thing here, I had my receipt.\nI asked for his name as I couldn't believe such a horrible attitude, points down to his badge as if I was an idiot with a smudge look on his face, his badge with a rainbow underneath, he was  certainly not all rainbows and butterflies, he left me very distressed and angry.

The car park and the areas within the car park are dirty and untidy with rubbish not picked up for months on end. Large pot-holes in the driveways. Public safety ignored by the store manager despite being made aware of the issues several times. Homeless people sitting outside the main entry door begging for money [not selling tickets] No area for staff to go for a smoke they sit within the ground level carpark to smoke and have their lunch break. Perishable Items left over from the day before marked as \"special\" but dearer than the day before. Price on shelf different to what is scanned at the checkout. Items with a expired use-by date left on shelf with a special sticker applied. Continually moving stock around making it difficult to locate having to ask staff - that's when you can find a staff member who is not tied up with customers.  Self checkouts continually mal-function.",

Spudshed meat has been absolutely awful in my experience and I will never buy it again, Aldi meat is okay, but inferior quality to Coles, Woolworths meat is about on par with Coles but more expensive, and Costco meat is just too extreme for me to even contemplate.
