Why on earth are there only a couple of registers open on the Friday prior to Father\u2019s Day?? I am in late 60s and just managed to get it all scanned and packed then up comes a staff member asking me to donate $2 to a cause! I donate regularly to many causes but at this particular instance found it appalling to even be asked as I was saving Coles paying a staff member to pack my purchase and I was actually working for them by doing my own transaction then get asked for more money!!!  Wake up Coles and open more registers then maybe you\u2019d have happier customers who keep coming back! I\u2019m going to Woolies next time!",

            "reviewBody": "I am a long time Coles customer. Since they sacked their own butcher meat supplies when I try to fry  steaks such as Scotch Fillet ($43 per kg) or porterhouse I get a fry pan full of water. A butcher told me that injecting water into meat is an old way to increase weight. Also in  several of my purchases of Scotch Fillet it was obvious that  these steaks were made of pieces glued together. Another scam told to me by a butcher friend. I am referring these findings onto the appropriate government investigators\n\nIn saying about the poor quality of the meat I must compliment Coles on their staff at this and other local supermarkets. Apart from expensive meats I will stay a Coles supporter due to the fabulous staff they employ.  Excellent ambassadors for the company ALL",

And after all, doing an online order is supposed to save time.\n\nI did an online delivery order with Coles which came from the Westfield Helensvale Store.  On Sundays they only use third party deliverers so it came with Door Dash (DD) who I haven't had an issue with before.\n\nBasically the dasher did not collect my cold food/frozen food part of the order, and I have now officially spent 50 mins of my time trying to sort that out.\n\nIn that time I've had to ring Coles twice and DD twice and then ring Coles Customer Service for a refund, as no-one would give me a redelivery.  The dasher had basically finished work and because that dasher wasn't available, DD wouldn't book another delivery.\n\nRinging Coles Helensvale was a nightmare.  I had to ring repeatedly as at times they wouldn't answer their phone, and when I asked to speak to a Manager, he kept calling me darling every 5 words or so (that impressed me, NOT).\n\nHe told me to ring DD (AGAIN) and then eventually DD rang Coles Helensvale and my only option was to ring Coles Customer Service/Care for a refund.\n\nI realise it was DD mistake, at least I presume it was, as I don't know the procedure at that end, but it should be foolproof at that end, in that there should be some alert about collecting separate cold items to the main delivery.\n\nI now need to attend store to get the rest of my order.\n\nThis was a ridiculous situation of blaming each other and NO-ONE wanting to resolve it properly.\n\nSo unimpressed and yes this will be posted all around social media.\n\nThanks Coles Helensvale, you have NOT won a fan.  Perhaps try to look after your customers when something like this occurs instead of making them run around to sort it out.\n\nAnd Mr Manager at Coles Helensvale, no woman likes being called DARLING every five words by someone they do not know.  Sheesh :(",
