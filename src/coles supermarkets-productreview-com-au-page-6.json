            "reviewBody": "It's the night before Easter, 5 hours before closing I had phoned Coles to see if my order had been received at Port Macquarie, I was told it had and everything was in order; and, I was told they would SMS me when the order was ready to be picked up.  \n\n3 Hours before closing I picked up the groceries, bank statement showed monies had been taken out; when the girl was putting the bags in the car, something about it didn't seem right and I realised there was no alcohol, also, the bags seemed light.  I didn't know what to do (and I was not dressed for shopping) so I asked to speak to the manager.  Expecting they'd get the alcohol.\n\nHe said what I ordered wasn't available, I said but, the monies paid for it.  He said there was nothing he could do they had an affiliation with Liquorland across the road. I said, what about if I haven't got the money.  He said I'd be refunded.  I said 'when, it's 3 hours before Easter, you've taken the money out of my a/c what am I going to do for Easter, and, how do I know I'll be refunded'.  He said with a smile, 'Coles will refund it'.  I became irate and showed it.  \n\nFacts their statement showed $30 less than that taken out of my bank.  Witness saw there were items missing, and also I read there were items unavailable at the time the CSO picked out groceries, but, the items missing that were not those 'unavailable' list.  \n\nWitnesses also noticed the bags smelt, this meant there had been sometime the seafood had be sitting for that to have happened. \n\n I'd placed the order around 11:30 pm the previous night.  Why couldn't they have phoned me when they realised they couldn't get the items and arranged for alternative ones.  Why couldn't they have given me a refund at the time of pick-up.  How could they have left a person in such disarray.  I explained guests were coming the next day and I had no money for alcohol.  The Manager just smiled and expected me to do likewise.",

I noted several possible products to purchase and then physically attended my store.\n\nLow and behold, the toilet paper shelves were almost empty and certainly did not contain stock of the brands I had earlier searched for.\n\nI verbalised my concerns to a male employee at the front desk and he trotted out all the 'usual' excuses relating to the damaged rail line between Perth and SA (long since repaired) and then Covid and the unavailability of storemen, drivers and various other employees working in the supply chain who are 'missing in action' due to Covid sickness. The problem with this enduring excuse is that most people are at worst, sick for 3-4 days and are thereafter well again and can/do go back to work.\n\nSo I rang Coles' so-called customer care line to articulate my frustration at the fact that their website gives misleading stock levels which do not reflect actual store availability. The employee response was that it is not possible to keep their online in-store stock levels accurate? Then what is the point of even having an online enquiry option?\n\nI am giving Coles a wide berth from now on until I can be assured that they are fully operational in WA.",

The computer email received 11.29 9th March 2022, shows the price of 'Solo Lemon 30 30Pack at $21.00 ea, Save $12.50. BUT I have been charged $33.50 for the single pack.\nI spoke to \"Sally\" instore with her checking the online price and it showed $33.50, but not the today price of $21.\nAt home I checked my docket and I was charged the wrong price of $33.50, so I phoned the store and was told the price on the shelf (by Trish) was 2 for $44 or 1 for 33.50, so I agreed to take the problem to the Scone manager tomorrow.",
