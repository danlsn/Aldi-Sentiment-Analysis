So for example, if you decide to treat yourself to a 500ml Breaka and a 400ml Pauls Zymil then you CANNOT purchase any additional 'fresh milk' products.  After a rather lengthy and somewhat tiresome messenger exchange with Coles Customer Service, they confirmed that although their website only refers to \"fresh milk\" having a 2 pack limitation, and that their own website excludes flavoured milk as being considered as \"fresh milk\", that if you'd like to indulge in a little flavoured milk drinkie then you'd need to defer your 'fresh milk' purchase to another time.  That's about the oddest thing I've heard in awhile for sure",

I noticed the customer in front of me had bought about six big plastic bags for her groceries. Are the checkout operators now pressuring customers into buying Coles bags? She said it was because I had trolley bags and she couldn't pack into them. I have never had trouble before and have been using these for about three years and this is the first time someone has refused to pack into them. I showed her how to hook the handle over two of the loops and she still refused to pack them. If this is going to be a 'norm', I will start to shop elsewhere. I am happy to say that I have never used a Coles bag and definitely do not intend to start now even if they were free., https://au.oceaniabiz.com/queensland/coles-maroochydore-37090",

Yet if I want to buy a slab of coke I'm gauranteed to save more than half price. Same deal on chips, chocolate, lollies, icecream and all other unhealthy junk food. Don't expect to eat healthily at a reasonable price at Coles. And Woolworths are no better! They just price match the same specials at Coles and offer no better value. The 2 large corporations are taking us all for mugs! Profits before People. Will be shopping elsewhere.",

            "reviewBody": "Hi, Over the last 3 months or so I have been refused by many staff to slice your Primo Chili Coated Salami. Eg Xmas Eve - Attended Mudgee, approx 5 staff in the deli, approx 4.30 pm and I was told they would not slice the meat as the slicer had gone home, so I then drove to Bathurst approx 2 hours away, only to be told the same, that they would not shave or slice this for me as the Slicers were off, I then traveled through to Goulburn a further 5 hours, only to be told the Deli is shut but that they had no one who would slice any meat anyway. Approx 2 weeks before this I attended Batemans Bay Coles at approx 5 pm as well as Muswellbrook, again where staff refused to slice any Salami. Take your signs down as this is false advertising, and given that this is regular practice, this is the most disgusting customer service and I will notify Primo as Coles seems to have exclusive rights to this product. I live rurally where it is no less than 1.5 hours to do any shopping and to continue to get this level of service is appalling. Your staff needs training or you need to take your statements down which are on every Coles wall which states that \"You will slice Fresh Meat\". This is deceptive and misleading advertising, and wondering what the legal position is on this? It seems to be that none of your NSW staff have any interest in good customer service at $32 a KG, just curious if COLES Head office is aware how much money is being lost through nasty Deli Service??",

            "reviewBody": "Bad coles. Big corporations ripping off consumers. Bought samsung phone from coles. Put coles simcard in it, but it is network locked to telstra. They will charge me $25 to unlock sim network. When I buy a phone outright, that means it is my property, should not be locked to one provider and consumers need to be made aware if they are locked. I signed no contract with telstra and now my phone is not fit for purpose under Australian consumer law. I should be able to put as many different sims in as I wish. Coles in bed with telstra to rip off consumers.",
