You'd think they would reduce the price when their apples are of a low grade. 10 odd apples cost in excess of $12, at that price you would expect a premium product. My local grocery shop sells them at the same price but are premium, that's where I will be buying in the future.",

It's sad because a staff member on behalf of Coles has decided to take advantage of the situation and deny my single income family savings to further their bottom line. What's more damming is the Store Manager is backing his staff's decision as nobly as it is but on what premise was her discretionary decision made. Let's hope it's not bias and that the same treatment is dished out to favourable people in her eyes. Where's your Christmas spirit?? staff at Coles Ashfield!",
