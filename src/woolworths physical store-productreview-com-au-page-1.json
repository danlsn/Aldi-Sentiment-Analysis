Somebody else stole it as it just sits there with no indications that it hadn't been taken. If I don't put a 50 cent candy in their bagging station the entire machine grinds to a stop but when the shoe is on the other foot I have to get police involved to get my money back. If you want to be an ATM then you need to swallow money and cards that aren't being taken or are being utilised in a suspicious manner. You can't be a local banking outlet and not provide bank level security. The staff members were very polite and helpful but once again the company is taking the money and not offering the service. Edit, I rang the manager and he is going to give me the money and charge the customer as stealing from woolies. Yay for woolies and their cctv, this is why I shop at woolies. Changed from 1 star to five!",

I think someone just got sick of the phone ringing because there was nobody there.\n\nI was at the glen Innes Woolworths. Went through the check out. Put my pin in three times and three times refused. I was then taken up to the front desk where we tried to break up the sale, but because it had been declined three times.\n\nAn (honest) young woolies employee then came up to me and said \"Were you at the end check out' i said \"Yes\" then she said \"its a problem with the machine there. It doubles the first number you put in\".\n\nIf it is a known problem why not warn customers before they go through? Better still - fix the problemx?\n\nI called my bank. I now have to change my pin number. I ended up just walking out and leaving my shopping there.\n\nGood on you Woolies. How rediculous that you would not bother to fix a known problem that would inconvenience customers so much right before Christmas.\n\nK. Gleeson",

            "reviewBody": "I stopped at WA Singleton store the other day to buy some frozen foods and took my items to a checkout but was told to go to another one as this was closing down. I moved to line up at the other checkout only to be told it too was closing down and to move for another one . At least 2 other customers in the same situation trying to pay for their items and not a single checkout opened. Meanwhile 3 staff were standing and chatting near the self checkouts and one of them pointed to them asking us to use them. Also 2 more staff were at the self checkout exit checking customer receipts yet not one of them willing to open up a checkout for customers. After almost 5 minutes of trying to have a checkout open one of the customers decided to leave the trolley with goods behind and walk out of the store.  I was just about to follow her but finally one of the staff opened up the 12 items or less counter so we could pay for the items.  I understand that the stores are trying to increase profits by getting all customers to use self serve but customers are not getting any discounts for using them and there is no saving for shareholders either when at least 5 staff are hanging around the checkouts and getting paid but refusing to serve waiting customers.  Needless to say I will take the advice of one of the other customers in line behind me and if I can avoid it will never set foot in another Woolworths again. Aldi may not be an Australian company but has cheaper grocery prices and is not pushing customers into using self serve checkouts.",

Even advising Woolworths on their Facebook page a week ago (1/12/22) has achieved no results. Many customers enjoy buying these as their lunch meals but we don't all have lunch at 12:00 - 12:30pm, so can Woolworths go back to providing excellent customer service for all pre- made sandwich lovers / customers for the entire day rather than only cater for just the 12:00pm - 12:30pm lunch customers? The elderly found this a bargain but insufficient stock and prices increasing from $6 - $6.50 to $8.50 - $9.00 is no bargain. You are better off going to a bakery and paying $7 for a pork roll.",
