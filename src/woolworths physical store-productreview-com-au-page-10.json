Full marks to the Woolies staff, they are all wearing masks and the clear acrylic screens around the staff in the checkout are still there.  The social distancing dots on the floor in checkout lines are still visible.  \n\nSo why does an unmasked woman (one we have seen unmasked in shops before) decide to stand behind us. She is putting her stuff on the conveyor as the conveyor moves forward slowly. We only have a few things (unusual for us). We are standing on our DOT and the person in front is still paying. \n\nBehind my back the unmasked woman behind decides to move into my personal space to lean in and rearrange her stuff on the  conveyor. She touched me. I turned around and said \"Excuse me, keep your distance\" she stands on her toes to object, so I reminded her about the DOTS. \n\nYes I have been vaccinated, but I don't want to be exposed to unnecessary risks because getting sick means not being able to work and everything else that flows on from that.\n\nKEEP THE SOCIAL DISTANCE, the Woolies staff should be reminding these pushy people because their actions also risk the Woolies staff Jobs.",

Because the price was different on the chicken I took a photo.\n\nWhen I got to check out I pointed this out and showed the photo to the check out person. He hit a bell and another person came over, grabbed the chicken and set off down the back. She returned and \"get someone from butchery\". Another person arrived and down the back again went the chicken, and came back with another chicken entirely, not this brand. I pointed out that is not the chicken on display and showed my photo again. \n\nAfter assertive insistence \"you have to give it to me at that price, I will only write in and complain\", the chicken went for another trip for some unexplained reason, turned out to be repriced. Anyhow I have the chicken, but what a sxxt fight to just buy chicken.\n\nPoint 1: Price things properly, the advertised price is the price. \nPoint 2: If you make a mistake (everybody makes a mistake), be nice about it and fix it, don't make an embarrassing argument with me at the checkout in front of all you are keeping waiting. I just want to buy a chicken not be held up for ridicule like I have done something wrong\nPoint 3: Staff dealing with problems should know how to do it, clearly these staff (with the exception of the checkout worker) were stressed, angry and winging it. Your training needs a review. \nPoint 4: Whoever gets called over should be empowered to resolve a little problem not uncommon problem such as this, not flick it on.\nPoint 5: Apology cost nothing, especially for such a small amount of money and where I am not at fault.\nPoint 5: Where have all the nice, helpful and competent staff gone? I have had such good experiences at this store (my local) over 15 years.\n\nWhen at the end of my \"happy journey to the shops\" (sic) I suggested given the runaround and public embarrassment I should be given the product free - In  keeping with what I thought was Woolworths Scanner Code of Practice, well you can guess how that went.\n\nSee below for the policy from their own website\n\nhttps://bunch.woolworths.com.au/article/10102991/Supermarket-Scanning-Policy#?sortby=RECENT\n\n\nNot happy, but neither is anyone else by the looks.",

The funny thing is Aldi is opening up in approx 1 month in our area and I can almost guarantee that a very large number of the current WOOLWORTHS Tura Beach customer base will start shopping at the new Merimbula Aldi because I'm quite sure they are also sick of being treated like dirt, as there is a number of Tura Beach WOOLWORTHS staff that treat customers with contempt, for myself and my family we won't be shopping Woolworths again, absolute grubs, my last comment, we are asked to treat staff at shopping centers with respect in regards to the abuse they are getting surrounding COVID well it goes both ways, some of these WOOLWORTHS staff members also need to remember that some customers they are in contact with could be carrying injuries mentally and DONT need the added pressure of someone who doesn't like their job.",

Next day get mths email, no stock all sold, what a total waste of time and effort, they don\u2019t even put ordered and paid for items aside so missed out altogether. I used a Woolworths gift card to pay for the fryer and they tried to give me a STORE credit to be used within a short time and had to be with an order of $30 or more. This I totally refused to accept and after contacting Woolworths got a digital gift card for future use.

It's absolutely disgusting especially with the current pandemic. i had to spit the roll out and throw them all away, wasting  my money and peace of mind and possibly affecting my health.",

            "reviewBody": "4 Rude, unhelpful obnoxious staff including Duty Supervisor- I visited Woolworths Town Hall on Sat evening 21st of August, and after spending over $20 in store, I wanted to exchange 3 coins- that i received in-store for one 50 cent piece; however all 4 staff members- all refused, including male at ground floor counter, female at self-service check-in (ground floor) and female at ground floor counter- near entry door- who upon my complaining rung the supervisor, telling him i wanted to change my coins for a 50 cent piece. The supervisor, over the phone, with the female staff member also refused my request. So that is four staff members, including supervisor refused my request. This is poor unsatisfactory rude customer service, as i received these coins in store, and had a receipt. You permit customers to do cash transactions, but when i wanted to exchange a coin, four staff members all rudely refused, although i showed all 4 staff members my receipt. This is not how you treat regular customers!",
