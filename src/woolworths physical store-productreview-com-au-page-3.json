If they were not a huge corporation, they would be shut down by the government, but obviously, the Australian government(s) are only interested in lining their pockets through corporate stocks/equities and are owned by multi-national corporations.\n\nNever mind Covid-19, the Australian government(s) and most certainly big corporations like Woolworths do not care about your health or well being.\nAlso in the news is how bad Australian pesticides are with fresh and packaged produce compared to other developed nations. Scary as eff!\n\nI don\u2019t know what the alternative is. We are slaves to capitalism and small amd medium sized food companies have little chance of survival. \n\nThings are just wrong\u2026 but keep watching channel(s) 7,9, and 10 and you\u2019ll be lulled into a state of fear where everything outside of conforming and accepting the corporate rule and crimes as acceptable and keep on that hamster wheel.

You can't tell much in the image since it's bad quality but all the dough on the inside was still raw. Please get the bakers to bake them better because you can't go selling raw scones with uncooked dough that lool like this!!",

This information was provided by their own bakery staff.   2cm thick slices are too thick even for toast. There is little point in offering sliced bread if the stores are not able to provide normal thickness for sandwiches and or toast.\nWoolworths are making record profits, one of the industries that have done extremely well during the pandemic, perhaps some of these profits could go to providing new bread slicing machines in their stores.\nSince writing this review and providing feedback to Woolworths, their customer hub has responded (along with a $10.00 store voucher) that the matter will be discussed at the next appropriate meeting. This was an unexpected surprise, but I doubt that anything will change unless they receive more feedback on the same issue.",
