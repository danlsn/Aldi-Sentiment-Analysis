I remembered the pain was the same when using macleans toothpaste bought from Woolworths so i checked the label and its from south Africa.

Today, Monday 22 August at 18:58, i showed the female staff member at the self-service counter my items from another store before entering. Then when i exited, she insisted on checking all the compartments of my backpack. I found this excessive and rude, as i already showed her my previously purchased items when entering the store. Although i haven't visited Blacktown Woolworths for a few years, I don't think i will come back. I previously submitted complaints about them, but the behaviour continues- they make you feel like a criminal. I do not know why she had to check all my backpack compartments, when i had already showed her my previously purchased items. Plus, i have visited other Woolworths in Sydney, and they do not make you feel like a criminal and treat people a bit better. Only Blacktown Woolworths insist on checking all your compartments- this is wrong as I already showed her my purchased items upon entering.",

            "reviewBody": "To whom it may concern,\n\nIt's now the 15th of August 2022, maybe a couple of years ago I was in the Ipswich Riverlink store in Queensland to purchase the Woolworths branded 2L tomato sauce only to find the product price had increased from $4.00 to a ghastly $5.50, that's  a 37.8% increase in price.  When refining manufacturing methods production prices drop, this particular price increase on this item I believe was just a corporate/shareholder money grab on a low priced item.  \n\nAfter writing my review that was posted on Google.com.au, the relevant staff member virtually immediately returned the price  of the item to the more reasonable figure.  \n\nWhat we are seeing each an every time we enter these corporate giant stores is the same behavior; as an example, within a  3 month period the Woolworths branded(the Woolworths Essentials and slightly more visually appealing Woolworths brands appear to be dissolving to be replaced for one by the newer even more colorful Bell Farms which they charge a heck of a lot more money for) Australian Steakhouse Chips were $2.00/kg three to four months ago, the price then increased to $2.40/kg a 20% increase in price then only a matter of possibly a month ago the price increased again to $3.00/kg again yet another 25% increase.\n\nAnother example of the corporate/shareholder dividend driven greed of this monopolizing, what I believe to be price fixing practices(even if it is in a local proximity basis, as for years in different suburbs in South East Queensland when the major grocery suppliers are within a relatively short walking distance of one another; I have been in the other major grocery suppliers outlet to see Woolworths staff with writing pad and pen writing down products and prices and I\u2019ve seen the other major grocery suppliers staff members walking through Woolworths stores doing the same thing.  I think they are sensible enough not to be in collusion with each other, but why fight a price war when they can both win by not trying to compete but by equally gouging.  This is why aside from promotional items there is no price difference between Woolworths and its greatest competitor) we are subjected to paying is Gravox Traditional Gravy 120g; I was lost for words other an expletives when on the 5th August 2022 the price of this item had jumped from the regular Woolworths rip-off price of $3.80/unit to $5.00, again a 31.57% price increase.  Yet, I checked with a major online supplier this morning to compare prices confirming yet again Woolworths is doing their best to bend me over the checkout.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I've heard it from team members that they are not responsible for price increases.   A great many of the team members working within the stores are shareholders within Woolworths, so don't believe it when you are told that they are not responsible for price increases.  \n\nOn another occasion, I purchased one single item from the service counter at the Ipswich Riverlink Store where the attendant asked me for the exact figure for the item being $1.55.  I gave the dishonest, insolent, lazy individual a $2.00 coin to pay for the product and was asked if I required a receipt, to which I replied no thank-you; I was handed $0.25c change.  Before I had left the store I looked at the change I had been given and went back to the counter in pursuit of the $0.20c I had been deliberately short changed; fore when I returned to the store for another of the same product, being a single packet of Ranch branded regular roll your own cigarette filters the price had been upped to the price point of $1.75, in an attempt to mask the fact that I had been deliberately short changed.  I now purchase this product from a tobacconist within the center who is cheaper than the original Woolworths price; when a tiny franchise tobacconist betters the price of the corporate giant Woolworths - it just goes to show how much price gouging we experience when we subjected to purchasing through these outlets.\n\nI have had many positive interactions with other customer service team members that greatly outweigh the negative experience detailed above.  But I'm sorry to say that negative experience has left me expecting to literally have my pockets picked when I regrettably frequent these stores.\n\nMore and more I am finding the somewhat impersonal shopping experience and unsurpassed customer service I receive from a faceless global online giant that has only been operating within our country for 26 years, saves me a great deal more money in the pricing of the products they sell and they deliver for free, unlike Woolworths.\n\nI have read a great many of the reviews regarding Woolworths, the behavior I have experienced along with what I have read here only drive my resolve to abandon this major.  I've heard it said at times Australian shoppers get a raw deal when it comes to receiving good customer service, well product pricing is a part of customer service and these incremental dividend driven price increases reinforce that fact.\n\nWith money as tight as it is for each of us, RAISE YOUR VOICE fellow Australians in protest against this greed we are subjected to and watch the prices return to where they once were as I did.  Incidentally the Woolworths branded 2L Tomato sauce has in the last month now risen on queue to $4.70/unit.  \n\n This is why do my best not to shop at Woolies.",

First shop , I was told to get out of the way of the freezer, by a night fill staff member,  as I was in the way of him filling the freezer with new stock. I wanted to complain,  as he was very rude as he told me to get out of the way,  but I thought about my time in retail and thought he was just trying to do his job. \nThe other occasion I wish to complain about is the check out operator I had, she was rude, had no eye contact and didn't speak a word to me, until she snapped at me if I wished to use my credit of my shop. I requested if there was any fixem's left. I got yelled at NO.\nThe only good thing I discovered in my in my 3 shops, was a lovely male  checkout operator, with very big dark hair (afro) I am so sorry I didn't get his name, but he was wonderful, and he is the only reason I gave the review a 3 otherwise it would be a 1, which is terrible.",

Looked around and could not see an express checkout. \nI then asked the assistant at the self serve checkouts where is the express checkout? No longer express,  either go here or go and queue up.\nI requested to speak to the Manager and voiced my opinion to him that I only wanted 2 items, I don't use self serve checkouts and I should not have to queue up with loaded trolleys for 2 items.  He claims it is so they can manage queues more efficiently now as they are all visible in one line , not split up with a counter in the middle and checkouts either side. He thanked me for the feedback.\nAlso the assistant at the self service was of little assistance to me. She said move your bag from the left side to this side and scan your item and walked off to chat with another employee. That was it.\nWoolworths, please do not do away with express checkouts when you makeover your other stores.",

It's been over a week since Woolworths mobile said they have already forwarded my complaint letter and photos to you.  Nothing heard from Woolworths supermarket yet.  So re post herewith.  Thanks for your time hope to hear from you soon.",
