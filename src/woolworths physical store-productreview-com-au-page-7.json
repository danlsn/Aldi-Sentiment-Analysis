In the last few months the recipe has changed and one bite I\u2019m throwing up. This is the case with sausages and chipolatas. Yesterday I purchased the sausage mince for sausage rolls for my daughters bday today while cooking them the amount of oil that came out of the mince was absolutely disgusting. I did start soaking with paper towel to try save them but in the end threw the lot out. So disappointed I made up 3 things of the mince and a packet of pastry absolute waste an now I have to run down to shops in morning an find a substitute for bday party. The photo pictured was one tray of 3 after trying to soak oil with paper towel.",

            "reviewBody": "There is a problem with the checkout registers at Woolworths stores in that they frequently double-scan grocery items.  I have had this happen to me on numerous occasions at different stores, and in different states.  Woolworths are fully aware of the issue as they readily admit to it each time I seek a refund for the overcharged items.  The problem appears to be affecting all stores right across the country.\n\nMy concern is they are robbing all the people that are too busy to check every line item on their receipts and seek a refund for the overcharged amount.  It seems Woolworths are not inclined to fix the problem as it's adding potentially millions of dollars to their revenue line.  Instead they blame it on new checkout operators for the error.  If that was truly the case then all their competitors would be seeing the same issue with their new checkout operators too.  Nope, I shop at all the major supermarket chains and it's only Woolworths that try to rip me off.\n\nHello ACCC, are you hearing this?  I would encourage everyone to check your recieipt before leaving the store and lodge a compalint with the ACCC for every occasion Woolworths attempts to defraud you.  If enough people complain, it wont be long before the ACCC will be forced to look into this practice and have Woolworths fix the problem.  Remember, the banks were issued huge fines and had to make public apologies when they were caught stealing off their customers!",

I think you already sensed that and were so polite and helpful and asked me how my day was going, this gave me the chance to get things off my chest and you not only listened wholheartedly but helped me and for that I am greatful. You showed so much positivity, and compassion. I am so very impressed with your service process from start to finish Well done.",

Instant noodles, 25%. Soft drinks, bread. I'm buying the going stale bread they discount for around 20% more than I was buying FRESH bread not so omg ago. I walked out of Woolworths last shopping day and my head was spinning. I'm on a pension and am already looking at Charity organizations to supplement what I suspect is price gouging by Woolworths. Pies went from $4 to $6 in the space of two months. One Woolworths worker, on being asked why, told me that she literally cried when she saw the pie prices as she has two teenage sons. Now, if someone who is WORKING at Woolies is in such despair I can only say that this is not the first time they've priced me out of being able to eat certain, once cheap and labelled \"Essential\" products but, it's the first time I've felt insulted by the incredible increase which means even the CHEAPEST products are out of my price range. Shame on Woolworths, shame. I'll be shopping around from here on in and not at their multinational corporation competitors because they all raise prices at the same time. Utterly disgusted... especially with all the wages theft that is STILL in the news regarding Woolworths. I intend taking this particular issue, Woolworths Pies, to the ACCC.",

            "reviewBody": "I purchased a packet of brisket bone for my dogs last week. I buy them because brisket is a porous bone that dogs can sink their teeth into & in turn keep them in good condition. Never in my many past purchases of these bones have I had to cut out & throw away so much  hard bone because it's not safe to feed my dog. Usually I am able to cut up the majority of the bones & give them to my dog but not this time. I'm really shocked that ive had to throw away 320grams of hard bone out of the 1.129kg overall weight. I've never ever had this happen before. I'm really disappointed",
