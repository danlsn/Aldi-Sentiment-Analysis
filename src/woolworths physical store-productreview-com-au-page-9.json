            "reviewBody": "After irresponsibly causing a rush on all stores by the full frontal fake 'apology' for lack of stock (read, advert) for Woolworths in the weekend papers Woolworths has then (i) still maintained 'specials' catalogues even if there is no stock and they anticipate delays and (ii) failed to maintain their websites with accurate stock advice. \n\nI have been looking for an advertised item in-store that has not been available and this was clearly stated as being in stock in my local store (Sunbury, Horne Street) today, so I walked up there in the heat (no access to a car), while obviously taking COVID-related risks (I'm trying to minimise the time I spend out as everyone should be to stop the spread), only to find that there was none in stock (and there is no substitute for this item either). \n\nI explained the situation (inc. the website and the walk) and asked for a raincheck, only to be rudely brushed off. If I had taken a chance and it was not available I'd put it down to bad luck, but it was clearly noted as being 'in stock'.\n\nSeems that Woolies are really only interested in getting the punters in and not on responsibly managing a supply-chain crisis. If they were serious, they'd either keep their websites up to date or remove the function of finding whether stock is in your local store entirely - and they'd stop advertising specials that they cannot honour and don't intend to honour - or, on special items they'd offer rainchecks. \n\nNot the first time Sunbury has let me down with rude and uncaring staff either.",

It would be a mistake, but I have encountered this practice several times in Woolworths and other  stores. They must be aware of this careless, misleading, practice.",

Tonight 2 girls who were behind us in line were coughing and  did not wear masks. This is mandatory at the moment and when I questioned them I was called names.
